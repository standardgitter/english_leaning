1
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:13,984
As one of the most notorious /nəʊˈtɔːrɪəs 臭名昭著的/ gangsters /ˈɡæŋstə 歹徒，流氓/
in history,

2
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:19,928
Al Capone presided /prɪˈzaɪd 主持/ over a vast /vɑːst/
and profitable empire of organized crime /kraɪm/.

3
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,738
When he was finally put on trial /ˈtraɪəl 审讯/,

4
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:26,363
the most he could be convicted /kənˈvɪkt 证明…有罪/ of
was tax evasion / ɪˈveɪʒən 逃避/.

5
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:28,604
The nearly $100 million a year,

6
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:32,308
that's 1.4 billion in today's currency,

7
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,737
that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling,

8
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:35,898
bootlegging /ˈbuːtˌleɡ 非法贩卖的；盗版的/,

9
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,045
brothels /ˈbrɒθəl 妓院/,

10
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:38,412
and extortion /ɪkˈstɔːʃən 勒索,敲诈/,

11
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,317
would have served as evidence
of his crimes.

12
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:44,985
But the money was nowhere
to be found.

13
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:49,265
Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses

14
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:52,736
whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven,

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,474
like cash-only laundromats /'lɔ:ndrəumæt 自助洗衣店/.

16
00:00:55,474 --> 00:01:00,605
In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity,

17
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,995
money laundering.

18
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:06,235
Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process

19
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:12,185
that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins,

20
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:16,516
allowing them to be used within
the legal economy.

21
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:20,375
But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money.

22
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:24,606
In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself.

23
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:27,536
Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters,

24
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:31,746
and pirates /ˈpaɪrɪt 海盗/ sought /seek/ to sell their bounty /baʊntɪ 战利品/
without drawing attention

25
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:33,836
to how they got it.

26
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:36,096
With the recent arrival 
of virtual /ˈvɜːtʃuəl/ currencies,

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,766
offshore banking,

28
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,467
the darknet,

29
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,136
and global markets,

30
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:44,607
schemes have become much more complex.

31
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:47,876
Although modern money laundering
methods vary /ˈveəri 变化/ greatly,

32
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:50,836
most share three basic steps:

33
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:51,948
placement /投放/,

34
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:53,138
layering /ˈleɪə 叠加/,

35
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,476
and integration /ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃn 整合/.

36
00:01:55,476 --> 00:02:00,337
Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets

37
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,366
that seem legitimate /lɪˈdʒɪtɪmɪt 使合法/.

38
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:05,656
That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account

39
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:11,737
registered to an anonymous /əˈnɒnɪməs/ corporation
or a professional middleman.

40
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:15,400
This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,967
since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system

42
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,899
seemingly out of nowhere.

43
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:26,278
The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions

44
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:30,067
to further distance the funds
from their origin.

45
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,127
This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts,

46
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,758
or the purchase of tradable property,

47
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:37,428
like expensive cars,

48
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:38,303
artwork,

49
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:39,917
and real estate.

50
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:43,780
Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second,

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,208
are also popular venues for layering.

52
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,609
A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available

53
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,960
at a casino /kəˈsiːnəʊ/ chain's locations 
in other countries,

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,709
or work with employees
to rig /rɪɡ 垄断；预先做手脚 操纵/ games.

55
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,260
The last step, integration /ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃn 整合/, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,059
and to benefit the original criminal.

57
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:08,669
They might invest it into a legal business

58
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,309
claiming payment by producing
fake /feɪk/ invoices,

59
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,950
or even start a bogus /ˈbəʊɡəs 伪造的 冒牌货/ charity /ˈtʃærɪtɪ/,

60
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,490
placing themselves 
on the board of directors

61
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,370
with an exorbitant /ɪɡˈzɔːbɪtənt 天价的/ salary.

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,689
Money laundering itself

63
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:26,950
wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986.

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,730
Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute /ˈprɒsɪˌkjuːt 对…提起公诉/ a related crime,

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,680
like tax evasion / ɪˈveɪʒən/.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,840
From 1986 on, they could confiscate /ˈkɒnfɪˌskeɪt 没收，充公/
wealth simply by demonstrating

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,610
that concealment /kənˈsiːlmənt 藏匿/ had occurred,

68
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,570
which had a positive effect on prosecuting /ˈprɒsɪˌkjuːt 对…提起公诉/
major criminal operations,

69
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,880
like drug traffickers /ˈtræfɪkə 贩子/.

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,901
However, a legal shift has raised concerns

71
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:53,931
involving privacy 
and government surveillance.

72
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,852
Today, the United Nations,

73
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:57,411
national governments,

74
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,992
and various nonprofits

75
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,932
fight against money laundering,

76
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:06,031
yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime.

77
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:08,816
And the most high-profile /ˈprəʊfaɪl 简介/ instances
of money laundering

78
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,803
have involved 
not just private individuals,

79
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:17,207
but major financial institutions /ˌɪnstɪˈtjuːʃən/
and government officials.

80
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:20,101
No one knows for sure the total
amount of money

81
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:22,833
that's laundered on a yearly basis,

82
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,833
but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
