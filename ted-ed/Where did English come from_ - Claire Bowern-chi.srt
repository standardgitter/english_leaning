1
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:10,657
When we talk about English,
we often think of it as a single language

2
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,997
but what do the dialects /ˈdaɪəˌlɛkt 方言；土语；地方话/ spoken
in dozens of countries around the world

3
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:17,050
have in common with each other,

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,980
or with the writings of Chaucer?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,028
And how are any of them related
to the strange words in Beowulf?

6
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:25,271
The answer is that like most languages,

7
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,326
English has evolved  /ɪˈvɒlv 发展；进化/
through generations of speakers,

8
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:31,307
undergoing major /ˈmeɪdʒə/ changes over time.

9
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:33,340
By undoing these changes,

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,779
we can trace the language 
from the present /ˈprɛzənt/ day

11
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:38,403
back to its ancient /ˈeɪnʃənt/ roots.

12
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,536
While modern English 
shares many similar words

13
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:42,938
with /ˈlætɪn/ Latin-derived /dɪˈraɪvd 衍生的/ romance /rəuˈmæns/ languages,

14
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:44,582
like French and Spanish,

15
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:47,723
most of those words 
were not originally part of it.

16
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:50,271
Instead, they started coming 
into the language

17
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:55,087
with the Norman /ˈnɔːmən 诺曼第人/ invasion 
of England in 1066.

18
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:57,632
When the French-speaking Normans
conquered /ˈkɒŋkə/ England

19
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:59,649
and became its ruling class,

20
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,793
they brought their speech with them,

21
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:05,266
adding a massive /ˈmæsɪv 大规模的/ amount 
of French and Latin vocabulary

22
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,286
to the English language 
previously /ˈpriːvɪəslɪ 先前地/ spoken there.

23
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:11,049
Today, we call that language Old English.

24
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,495
This is the language of Beowulf.

25
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:15,609
It probably doesn't look very familiar,

26
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,915
but it might be more recognizable
if you know some German.

27
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,807
That's because Old English
belongs to the Germanic language family,

28
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:27,595
first brought to the British Isles /aɪl 岛/
in the 5th and 6th centuries

29
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:31,179
by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.

30
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:35,901
The Germanic dialects they spoke would
become known as Anglo-Saxon.

31
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,931
Viking /ˈvaɪkɪŋ/ invaders in the 8th 
to 11th centuries

32
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,943
added more borrowings 
from Old Norse into the mix.

33
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:45,771
It may be hard to see the roots
of modern English

34
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,634
underneath all the words borrowed

35
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:51,738
from French, Latin, Old Norse 
and other languages.

36
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:56,904
But comparative /kəmˈpærətɪv 比较的/ linguistics /lɪŋˈɡwɪstɪks 语言学/ can help us
by focusing on grammatical /ɡrəˈmætɪkəl 语法的/ structure,

37
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,733
patterns of sound changes,

38
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,175
and certain core vocabulary.

39
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:03,682
For example, after the 6th century,

40
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:09,011
German words starting with "p,"
systematically /ˌsɪstəˈmætɪklɪ 系统地，有计划地/ shifted to a "pf" sound

41
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:13,109
while their Old English counterparts
kept the "p" unchanged.

42
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,977
In another split, words 
that have "sk" sounds in Swedish /ˈswiːdɪʃ 瑞典语/

43
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:20,394
developed an "sh" sound in English.

44
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,236
There are still some English 
words with "sk,"

45
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:25,257
like "skirt," and "skull,"  /skʌl 头骨/

46
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,988
but they're direct borrowings 
from Old Norse

47
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:31,781
that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.

48
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,710
These examples show us

49
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,628
that just as the various Romance languages
descended /dɪˈsendɪd 的后裔/ from Latin,

50
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,603
English, Swedish, German, 
and many other languages

51
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:46,006
descended from their own common ancestor /ˈænsɛstə 祖先/
known as Proto-Germanic

52
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,854
spoken around 500 B.C.E.

53
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:52,301
Because this historical language
was never written down,

54
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:56,184
we can only reconstruct it 
by comparing its descendants,

55
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:59,302
which is possible thanks 
to the consistency /kənˈsɪstənsɪ 连贯性/ of the changes.

56
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:03,671
We can even use the same process
to go back one step further,

57
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:09,741
and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic
to a language called Proto-Indo-European,

58
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:11,922
spoken about 6000 years ago

59
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:16,512
on the Pontic steppe  /step 西伯利亚一带没有树木的大草原/
in modern day Ukraine /juːˈkreɪn/ and Russia.

60
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:20,843
This is the reconstructed ancestor /ˈænsɛstə 祖先/
of the Indo-European family

61
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:25,371
that includes nearly all languages
historically spoken in Europe,

62
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,711
as well as large parts of Southern
and Western Asia.

63
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,453
And though it requires a bit more work,

64
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:35,890
we can find the same systematic 
similarities /ˌsɪmɪˈlærɪtɪ 相似之处/, or correspondences /ˌkɒrɪˈspɒndəns 信函 一致/,

65
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,864
between related words in different
Indo-European branches.

66
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:42,085
Comparing English with Latin,

67
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:45,690
we see that English has "t" 
where Latin has "d",

68
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,728
and "f" where latin has "p"
at the start of words.

69
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,681
Some of English's more distant relatives
include Hindi, Persian /ˈpɜːʃən 波斯人/

70
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:58,109
and the Celtic languages it displaced /dɪsˈpleɪs 替换/
in what is now Britain.

71
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:02,769
Proto-Indo-European itself descended
from an even more ancient /ˈeɪnʃənt/ language,

72
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,908
but unfortunately, this is as far back
as historical /hɪˈstɒrɪkəl/ and archeological /ˌɑːkɪəˈlɒdʒɪkəl 考古学的/ evidence

73
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,088
will allow us to go.

74
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,280
Many mysteries /ˈmɪstərɪ 神秘/ remain just out of reach,

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,658
such as whether there might be a link
between Indo-European

76
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:17,841
and other major language families,

77
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,522
and the nature of the languages spoken
in Europe prior /ˈpraɪə 优先的/ to its arrival.

78
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:27,418
But the amazing fact remains that nearly
3 billion people around the world,

79
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,980
many of whom cannot understand each other,

80
00:04:29,980 --> 00:00:00,000
are nevertheless /ˌnɛvəðəˈlɛs 然而/ speaking the same words
shaped by 6000 years of history.
