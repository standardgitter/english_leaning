1
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:09,918
"Someone must have been telling
lies about Josef K.

2
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:14,791
He knew he had done nothing wrong,
but one morning, he was arrested."

3
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,756
Thus begins "The Trial /审讯/,"

4
00:00:16,756 --> 00:00:20,754
one of author Franz Kafka /ˈkæfkə/ 's
most well-known novels.

5
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,194
K, the protagonist /prəʊˈtæɡənɪst 主演/, 
is arrested out of nowhere

6
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:26,477
and made to go through
a bewildering / bɪˈwɪldə 使迷惑，使不知所措/ process

7
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:28,635
where neither the cause of his arrest,

8
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:31,011
nor the nature 
of the judicial /dʒuːˈdɪʃəl 公正的；司法的，法庭的/ proceedings

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,168
are made clear to him.

10
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:37,197
This sort of scenario /sɪˈnɑːrɪˌəʊ 情节；剧本；方案/ is considered
so characteristic of Kafka's work

11
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:39,787
that scholars came up 
with a new word for it.

12
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:44,954
Kafkaesque /ˌkæfkəˈesk 卡夫卡风格/ has entered the vernacular /vəˈnækjʊlə 本地风格   方言/
to describe unnecessarily complicated /ˈkɒmplɪˌkeɪtɪd 复杂的/

13
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:47,663
and frustrating /frʌˈstreɪt 挫败/ experiences,

14
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:51,955
like being forced to navigate labyrinths /ˈlæbərɪnθ 迷宫；错综复杂的事物/
of bureaucracy /bjʊəˈrɒkrəsɪ 官僚主义/.

15
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:55,191
But does standing in a long line
to fill out confusing paperwork

16
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:58,441
really capture the richness 
of Kafka's vision?

17
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:03,262
Beyond the word's casual /ˈkæʒjʊəl 偶然的 非正式的/ use,
what makes something Kafkaesque?

18
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:08,319
Franz Kafka's stories do indeed deal
with many mundane /ˈmʌndeɪn 平凡的，单调的/ and absurd /əbˈsɜːd 荒谬的，可笑的/ aspects

19
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,131
of modern bureaucracy /bjʊəˈrɒkrəsɪ/,

20
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:14,390
drawn in part from his experience
of working as an insurance clerk

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,080
in early 20th century Prague /prɑːɡ/.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,382
Many of his protagonists /prəʊˈtæɡənɪst 主演/
are office workers

23
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:22,098
compelled /kəmˈpɛl 强迫/ to struggle through
a web of obstacles /ˈɒbstəkəl n 障碍（物），干扰/

24
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:24,546
in order to achieve their goals,

25
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:29,194
and often the whole ordeal /ɔːˈdiːl 折磨，严酷的考验/ turns out
to be so disorienting /dɪsˈɔːrɪent 使迷失方向/ and illogical / ɪˈlɒdʒɪkəl 不合逻辑的/

26
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:33,326
that success becomes pointless /ˈpɔɪntlɪs 不得要领的/
in the first place.

27
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,700
For example, in the short story, 
"Poseidon /pɔ'saidn/,"

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,056
the Ancient Greek god is an executive
so swamped /swɒmp 使沉没/ with paperwork

29
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:44,015
that he's never had time to explore
his underwater domain.

30
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:47,472
The joke here is that not even
a god can handle the amount of paperwork

31
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:50,201
demanded by the modern workplace.

32
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,352
But the reason why is telling.

33
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:55,108
He's unwilling to delegate /ˈdɛlɪˌɡeɪt/ any of the work

34
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:59,079
because he deems /diːm 认为 主张/ everyone else 
unworthy of the task.

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,230
Kafka's Poseidon is a prisoner
of his own ego /ˈiːɡəʊ 自我；自负；完全人/.

36
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,570
This simple story contains 
all of the elements

37
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,104
that make for a truly Kafkaesque scenario /sɪˈnɑːrɪˌəʊ 情节/.

38
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:11,692
It's not the absurdity  /əbˈsɜːdɪtɪ 荒谬/
of bureaucracy /bjʊəˈrɒkrəsɪ/ alone,

39
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:16,288
but the irony of the character's 
circular /ˈsɜːkjʊlə/ reasoning in reaction to it

40
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,940
that is emblematic /embliˈmætik 标志的，象征性的/ of Kafka's writing.

41
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,473
His tragicomic /trædʒi'kɔmik 悲喜剧/ stories act as a form of
mythology /mɪˈθɒlədʒɪ 神话/  for the modern industrial /ɪnˈdʌstrɪəl/ age,

42
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,417
employing dream logic to explore
the relationships

43
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:33,008
between systems of arbitrary /ˈɑːbɪtrərɪ 任意的，武断的；专制的 / power
and the individuals caught up in them.

44
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:37,261
Take, for example, Kafka's 
most famous story, "Metamorphosis /ˌmɛtəˈmɔːfəsɪs 变形/."

45
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,942
When Gregor Samsa awaken's one morning
to find himself transformed

46
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,949
into a giant insect,

47
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:46,221
his greatest worry 
is that he gets to work on time.

48
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,823
Of course, this proves impossible.

49
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:54,319
It was not only the authoritarian /ɔːˌθɒrɪˈteərɪən 独裁主义者/ realm /rɛlm 王国 领域/
of the workplace that inspired Kafka.

50
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,601
Some of his protagonists /prəʊˈtæɡənɪst/' struggles
come from within.

51
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,387
The short story, "A Hunger Artist,"

52
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:05,320
describes a circus /ˈsɜːkəs 马戏团；马戏表演 / performer whose act
consists of extended fasts.

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,389
He's upset that the circus master
limits these to 40 days,

54
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,035
believing this prevents him from achieving
greatness in his art.

55
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,577
But when his act loses popularity /ˌpɒpjʊˈlærɪtɪ/,

56
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:19,103
he is left free 
to starve himself to death.

57
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:22,440
The twist comes when he lays dying
in anonymity /ˌænɒˈnɪmɪtɪ  匿名/,

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,975
regretfully admitting that his art
has always been a fraud.

59
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:28,132
He fasted not through strength of will,

60
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:32,165
but simply because he never found
a food he liked.

61
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,362
Even in "The Trial,"

62
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,887
which seems to focus 
directly on bureaucracy,

63
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:40,974
the vague /veɪɡ 模糊不清的/ laws and bewildering /bɪˈwɪldə 迷惑/ procedures
point to something far more sinister /ˈsɪnɪstə 危险的 阴险的/:

64
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:44,913
the terrible momentum /məʊˈmɛntəm 动量/ of the legal system
proves unstoppable,

65
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:48,359
even by supposedly powerful officials.

66
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,798
This is a system 
that doesn't serve justice,

67
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:54,608
but whose sole function 
is to perpetuate /pəˈpetʃʊˌeɪt 使永存/ itself.

68
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,484
What political theorist Hannah Arendt,

69
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,620
writing years after Kafka's death,

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,854
would call "tyranny /ˈtɪrənɪ 暴政；暴虐/ without a tyrant /taɪrənt  暴君/."

71
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:05,104
Yet accompanying 
the bleakness /ˈbliːknɪs 荒芜；苍凉/ of Kafka's stories,

72
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,851
there's a great deal of humor

73
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:10,570
rooted in the nonsensical /nɒnˈsensɪkəl 荒唐的/ logic
of the situations described.

74
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,855
So on the one hand, it's easy to recognize
the Kafkaesque in today's world.

75
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:20,949
We rely on increasingly convoluted /ˈkɒnvəˌluːt 卷曲的 回旋/ systems
of administration

76
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,973
that have real consequences on
every aspect of our lives.

77
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,941
And we find our every word judged
by people we can't see

78
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,096
according to rules we don't know.

79
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:36,787
On the other hand, by fine-tuning /tun 曲调/
our attention to the absurd /əbˈsɜːd 荒诞/,

80
00:04:36,787 --> 00:04:40,596
Kafka also reflects our shortcomings /ˈʃɔːtˌkʌmɪŋ 缺点，短处/
back at ourselves.

81
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:45,603
In doing so, he reminds us that the world
we live in is one we create,

82
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:49,603
and have the power 
to change for the better.
