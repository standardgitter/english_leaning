1
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,043
In the summer of 1976,

2
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,996
a mysterious /mɪˈstɪərɪəs  神秘的/ epidemic /ˌɛpɪˈdɛmɪk 流行病/
suddenly struck /strʌk strike/ two central African towns,

3
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:16,652
killing the majority of its victims.

4
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:18,391
Medical researchers suspected

5
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,829
the deadly Marburg virus 
to be the culprit /ˈkʌlprɪt 罪犯/.

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:26,667
But what they saw in microscope /ˈmaɪkrəˌskəʊp/ images
was an entirely new pathogen /ˈpæθəˌdʒɛn 病原体/,

7
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:31,323
which would be named
after the nearby Ebola /iːˈbəʊlə/ river.

8
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,225
Like yellow fever or dengue /ˈdɛŋɡɪ 登革热/,

9
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:38,677
the disease caused by the Ebola virus
is a severe /sɪˈvɪə 严重的/ type of hemorrhagic /ˌheməˈrædʒɪk 出血性的/ fever.

10
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:41,645
It begins by attacking 
the immune /ɪˈmjuːn 免除的/ system's cells

11
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,012
and neutralizing /nju:trəlaiziŋ 中和/ its responses,

12
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,354
allowing the virus to proliferate /prəˈlɪfəˌreɪt 激增/.

13
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:49,889
Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
after contraction,

14
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,260
initial /ɪˈnɪʃəl/ symptoms like high temperature,

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,451
aching,

16
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,640
and sore /sɔː 溃疡/ throat /θrəʊt/

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,109
resemble /rɪˈzɛmbl 类似/ those of a typical flu,

18
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:59,309
but quickly escalate to vomiting /ˈvɒmɪt 呕吐/,

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,551
rashes /ræʃ 皮疹/,

20
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:01,933
and diarrhea /ˌdaɪəˈrɪə 腹泻/.

21
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,432
And as the virus spreads,

22
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:05,947
it invades the lymph /lɪmf 淋巴/ nodes 
and vital /ˈvaɪtəl 至关重要/ organs,

23
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:10,069
such as kidneys /ˈkɪdnɪ 肾脏/ and liver,
causing them to lose function.

24
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,799
But the virus itself 
is not what kills Ebola victims.

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,541
Instead, the mounting /ˈmaʊntɪŋ 逐渐增加的/ cell deaths 
trigger an immune system overload,

26
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,006
known as a cytokine /ˈsaɪtəʊˌkaɪn 细胞活素/ storm,

27
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,930
an explosion of immune responses
that damages blood vessels /ˈvɛsəl 血管/,

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,170
causing both internal /ɪnˈtɜːnəl/ and external /ɛkˈstɜrnəl 外部/ bleeding.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,593
The excessive /ɛkˈsɛsɪv 过多的/ fluid /ˈfluːɪd 液体/ loss 
and resulting complications

30
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:36,513
can be fatal /ˈfeɪtəl 致命的/ within six to sixteen days
of the first symptoms,

31
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,172
though proper /ˈprɒpə 适合的/ care and rehydration /ˌriːhaɪˈdreɪʃən （脱水后的）再次水化/ therapy

32
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:43,156
can significantly reduce 
mortality /mɔːˈtælɪtɪ 必死性/ rates in patients.

33
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,878
Fortunately, 
while Ebola is highly virulent /ˈvɪrjʊlənt 致命的/,

34
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:48,866
several factors limit its contagiousness /kənˈteɪdʒəsnɪs 传染性/.

35
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:52,595
Unlike viruses that proliferate /prəˈlɪfəˌreɪt 使激增/ through
small, airborne /ˈɛəˌbɔːn 空运的 空气传播的/ particles /ˈpɑːtɪkəl 微粒/,

36
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:55,573
Ebola only exists in bodily fluids,

37
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,659
such as saliva /səˈlaɪvə 唾液/,

38
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,369
blood,

39
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,173
mucus /ˈmjuːkəs 鼻屎/,

40
00:01:58,173 --> 00:01:58,892
vomit /ˈvɒmɪt 呕吐物/,

41
00:01:58,892 --> 00:01:59,984
or feces /ˈfiːsiːz 排泄物/.

42
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,261
In order to spread,

43
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:05,449
these must be transmitted from 
an infected /ɪnˈfektɪd 被感染的/ person into another's body

44
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:09,273
through passageways /ˈpæsɪdʒˌweɪ 通道/ such as the eyes,
mouth, or nose.

45
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:11,113
And because the disease's severity /siˈverəti 严重/

46
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:14,274
increases directly along 
with the viral /ˈvaɪrəl 病毒的/ load,

47
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:17,196
even an infected person 
is unlikely to be contagious /kənˈteɪdʒəs 接触传染的/

48
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:19,923
until they have begun to show symptoms.

49
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:23,641
While Ebola has been shown 
to survive on surfaces for several hours,

50
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:27,912
and transmission through sneezing /sniːzɪŋ 打喷嚏/
or coughing /ˈkɒfɪŋ 咳嗽/ is theoretically /ˌθiːəˈretɪkəlɪ 理论上/ possible,

51
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:32,272
virtually /ˈvɜːtʃʊəlɪ 事实上/ all known cases of contraction
have been through direct contact

52
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:34,553
with the severely /sɪˈvɪəlɪ 严格地/ ill,

53
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,204
with the greatest risk 
posed to medical workers

54
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:40,095
and friends or relatives of the victims.

55
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:42,539
This is why,
despite its horrifying /ˈhɒrɪˌfaɪɪŋ 令人恐惧的/ effects,

56
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:47,155
Ebola has been far less deadly overall
than more common infections,

57
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,295
such as measles /ˈmiːzəlz 麻疹/,

58
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,118
malaria /məˈlɛərɪə 疟疾/,

59
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,811
or even influenza /ˌɪnflʊˈenzə 流行性感冒/.

60
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,615
Once an outbreak has been contained,

61
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,385
the virus does not exist 
in the human population

62
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,721
until the next outbreak begins.

63
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,810
But while this is undoubtedly a good thing,

64
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,821
it also makes Ebola difficult to study.

65
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:05,839
Scientists believe fruit /fruːt/ bats 
to be its natural carriers,

66
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:09,795
but just how it is transmitted to humans
remains unknown.

67
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,322
Furthermore, many of the countries 
where Ebola outbreaks occur

68
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:16,566
suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation /ˌsænɪˈteɪʃən 环境卫生/,

69
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:18,554
which enables the disease to spread.

70
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:20,157
And the poverty /ˈpɒvəti 贫困/ of these regions,

71
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:23,272
combined with the relatively /ˈrelətɪvli 相当地/ low amount
of overall /əʊvərɔːl 全部的/ cases

72
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:28,706
means there is little economic incentive /ɪnˈsentɪv 刺激/
for drug companies to invest /ɪnˈvest 投资/ in research.

73
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,625
Though some experimental medicines
have shown promise /ˈprɒmɪs/,

74
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,291
and governments are funding development
of a vaccine /ˈvæksiːn 疫苗/,

75
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,931
as of 2014,

76
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:40,074
the only widespread and effective 
solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain

77
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,412
isolation,

78
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:42,506
sanitation /ˌsænɪˈteɪʃən 环境卫生/,

79
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,007
and information.
