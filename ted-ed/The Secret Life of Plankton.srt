[Fish Tale
My Secret Life as Plankton /ˈplæŋktən/]

3
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,814
How did I get here?

4
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,557
Well, it's a stranger story
than you might think.

5
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:40,283
I came from a world of drifters /ˈdrɪftə 漂流者/,

6
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,886
a place few humans have ever seen.

7
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,585
The world of plankton.

8
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:52,158
I came from a batch /bætʃ/ of a million eggs,
and only a few of us survived.

9
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:58,732
When I became a larva /ˈlɑːvə/,
I moved among other drifters.

10
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:04,125
["Plankton" comes from the Greek
"planktos" for wandering /ˈwɒndərɪŋ 流浪的/]

11
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:13,329
My fellow plankton came in all sizes,
from tiny algae /ˈældʒi 藻类/ and bacteria

12
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:15,843
to animals longer than a blue whale.

13
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:25,374
I shared my nursery /ˈnɜːsrɪ 婴儿室/
with other embryos /ˈɛmbrɪˌəʊ 胚胎/ and juveniles /ˈdʒuvəˌnaɪl 幼态生物/,

14
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:29,364
from clams /klæm 蛤/ and crabs /kræb 蟹/
to sea urchins /ˈɜːtʃɪn 顽童 / 海胆 and anemones /əˈnemənɪ 海葵/.

15
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:33,745
(High pitch /pɪtʃ 达到高潮/ sound)

16
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:37,040
We drifting animals
are called zooplankton.

17
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:43,045
The most common animals here
are copepods /ˈkəʊpɪˌpɒd 桡足动物/ and krill /krɪl 磷虾/.

18
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,069
(Buzzing)

19
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,299
You could search the world over,

20
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:52,090
but you'd never find a place
more diverse /daɪˈvɜ:s 多样的/ than my childhood home.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,883
A teaspoon of seawater

22
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,771
can contain more
than a million living creatures.

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,914
It can be a pretty tough
existence, though.

24
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:09,080
Trillions are born here,
but only a few make it to adulthood /ˈædʌltˌhʊd/.

25
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:16,637
He may be no larger than a pin /pɪn 大头针/ head,

26
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:20,517
but this crab larva
is an arrow /ˈærəʊ 箭头/ worm's worst nightmare.

27
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,980
(Bumping noises)

28
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,633
(Buzzing)

29
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:40,434
Epic /ˈɛpɪk 史诗般的/ battles between carnivores /ˈkɑːnɪˌvɔː 食肉动物/
like these are just one way to get food.

30
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:46,014
But the real powers
of this place come from phytoplankton /ˌfaɪtəˈplæŋktən 浮游植物/.

31
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:48,567
Single-celled life

32
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,374
that transforms sunlight
and carbon dioxide /daɪˈɒksaɪd 二氧化物/

33
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:52,860
into edible gold.

34
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:04,608
Phytoplankton /ˌfaɪtəˈplæŋktən 浮游植物/ are the base
for the largest food web in the world.

35
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,621
During the night,

36
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:11,237
many animals like me
would rise up from the depths

37
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:14,136
to feed on this sun-powered feast /fiːst 盛宴/.

38
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:16,681
(Maraca sound)

39
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,732
I was part of the largest daily
migration /maɪˈɡreɪʃən/ of life on Earth.

40
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:26,760
During the day,

41
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:30,927
I'd return to the darkness,
where I'd join my bizarre /bɪˈzɑː 古怪的/ companions /kəmˈpænjən 同伴/.

42
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:34,205
(High pitch buzz)

43
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:35,422
(Flapping noises)

44
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:38,560
Cannibals /ˈkænɪbəl 吃同类的动物/, like this
sea butterfly mollusk /ˈmɒləsk 软体动物/,

45
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,261
that eats its next of kin /kɪn 同族/.

46
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,621
And comb /kəʊm 梳子/ jellies /ˈdʒɛlɪ 果冻 水母/,

47
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,864
that beat cilia /ˈsɪlɪə 纤毛/ like rainbowed eyelashes /ˈaɪˌlæʃ 睫毛/.

48
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,752
Some of these snare /snɛə 套索/
their prey /preɪ 猎物/ with sticky /ˈstɪkɪ 粘性的/ tentacles /ˈtɛntəkəl 触须/,

49
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:03,192
while others just take
a bite out of their cousins.

50
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,729
And siphonophores /ˈsaɪfənəˌfɔː 管水母/

51
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,341
that catch prey with toxic /ˈtɒksɪk/ fishing lures /lʊə 诱饵/.

52
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:19,024
But my favorite would have
to be the crustacean /krʌˈsteɪʃən 甲壳类/ Phronima.

53
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:23,568
Its monstrous /ˈmɒnstrəs 可怕的/ looks inspired
the movie "Aliens."

54
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,052
It can catch tiny bits in its bristles /ˈbrɪsəl 刚毛/,

55
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:30,765
but prefers larger prey like salps /sælp 樽海鞘/.

56
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:38,983
With two sets of eyes,
this female prowls /praʊl 潜行/ the deeper water.

57
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:43,114
Prey in hand,

58
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:45,796
she performs one
of the strangest behaviors

59
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,558
in the entire /ɪnˈtaɪə 全部的/ animal kingdom.

60
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,298
With body parts from her victims,

61
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:56,914
she delicately /ˈdelɪkətlɪ 精致地/ assembles
a barrel/ˈbærəl 桶/-like home

62
00:04:56,938 --> 00:05:00,651
feeding her young until they can drift off
and survive on their own.

63
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,861
Best of all, they make the perfect
snack for a small fish like me.

64
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,822
Here among the plankton,

65
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:18,421
the food web is so tangled /ˈtæŋɡəld 纠缠的/ and complex,

66
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:21,429
even scientists don't know who eats whom.

67
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,233
But I do.

68
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,794
At least now you know a bit of my story.

69
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:35,917
There's so much more to me
than just a tasty meal.
