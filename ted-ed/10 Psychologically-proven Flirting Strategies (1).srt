00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,460
[Intro]

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,900
Anyone who has attemped to foray into the great wide word of dating

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,040
knows that, when it comes to flirting,

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,060
cheesy pickup lines just don't cut it.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,320
Attracting a partner can be tricky,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,840
and there are many pitfalls one can fall into.

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,860
But when it comes down do it,

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,040
flirting is just an evolutionary tactic to acquire a mate for reproduction.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,620
With this in mind,

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,380
here's a list of 10 psychologically proven flirting strategies

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,180
that actually work!

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,200
Number 10: Eye Contact.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,500
Eye contact is key when it comes to desmonstrating your attraction to another person.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
When we make eye contact with a prospective partner,

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,800
we are actually searching for evidence of their attraction to us

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,120
through the psychological response of pupil dilation.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:10,220
This is also why staring into one another's eyes can often feels so intimate.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,920
Therefore, one of the best ways to let someone know you're interested in them

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,380
is to gave into their big brown, blue or green eyes.

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,620
Number 9: Wear red.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,540
Not only is red an eye catching color that flatters many different skin tones,

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,340
red is also a symbol of lust and sexuality.

23
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,760
with studies showing that, when both men and women wear red,

24
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,140
they appear more attractive to the opposite sex.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,540
This may be due to social expectations.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,120
However, psychologist Adam Pasteur suggests

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,620
that our attraction to red may be a hangover from humans evolutionary past,

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,800
as animals, such as female baboons,

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,960
display patches of bright red skin to indicate that they are ready to mate.

30
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,020
Number Eight: Be funny!

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,940
Humor is actually a huge factor in the search of a potential mate.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,320
University of New Mexico psychologist professor Jeffrey Miller

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,500
suggests that being funny is one of key ways we decide how attractive a partner is.

34
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,500
This is because, to be truly funny,

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,880
someone must be able to think quickly and be creative,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
skills that are extremely necessary for survival.

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,980
To be humorous is to be smart,

38
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,400
so telling a joke could just result in you getting that date you wanted.

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,620
Number Seven: play hard to get.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,900
Studies show that when we're unsure of how much someone likes us,

41
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,840
we actually like them more than when we're told they like us a lot.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,340
This could be due to the fact that playing hard to get

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,100
make someone seem more desirable and sometimes even out of our league.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,060
When someone seems too needy, we're likely to believe we can do better,

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,140
so it may be better to act aloof.

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,420
Number Six: are you a woman? Smile!

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,760
Not only it does a smile exhibit a sense of humor and a caring nature,

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,000
but it also displays a good health.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,060
Research from the University of British Columbia

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,960
suggests men find smilling women more attractive than prideful,

51
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,300
possibly because of its association with submission

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,580
and maternal urges.

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,200
Number Five: are you a man? Brood.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
The stereotype is true!

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,740
In the same study from the University of British Columbia,

56
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,300
researchers found that women rated smilling men

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,680
as the least attractive compared with prideful and shameful looking men.

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,920
Therefore, acting like a "bad boy" may win you a mate,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,820
regardless of whether you're actually bad or not.

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,640
Number Four: mirror body language.

61
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,020
55% of attraction communication is made through body language,

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,740
and one of the most subtle,

63
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,560
yet most effective methods of flirting with someone is to mirror their actions.

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,760
This is because we unconsciously copy those we're attracted to

65
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,120
as a sign we're interested in what they're saying.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,620
Mirroring someone demonstrates that we have good communication skills

67
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,060
but also that we're invested in their thoughts and feelings.

68
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,500
This is also a way of knowing whether someone is interested in you.

69
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,060
If they copy your mirroring,

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,480
they may just reciprocate your feelings.

71
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,860
Number Three: Be a smooth talker.

72
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,460
Pitch and tone actually have a lot more to do with flirting than one may think.

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,020
Research from MIT suggests that men are more attracted to women that

74
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,680
vary their tone at which they speak.

75
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,980
Women whose voices went up and down in frequency

76
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,640
received more romantic interest from men than those who speak with a flatter tone.

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,840
The same study also found that women were more attracted to men who

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,200
interjected when they were speaking with phrases

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,520
such as "I see", "Okay", and "Yup".

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,220
This not only suggests dominance but also understanding.

81
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,900
Number Two: Confidence is key.

82
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,720
A study by Doctor Monica Moore of Webster University

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,460
found that, when observing real-life person in bars and shoppings malls,

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,720
it was not the most physically appealing people

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,820
that were most often approached for flirtation.

86
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,280
Instead, those who signal their confidence through

87
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,280
basic flirting techniques, such as smiling, were more likely to attract others.

88
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,940
And, Number One: Touch them.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,480
Most research has demonstrated that

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,280
touching a person can increase their compliance to complete a wide variety of requests,

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
and this may extend to the world of flirtation!

92
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,240
Dr. Moore found that when a young male confederate in a nightclub asked young women to dance with him,

93
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,720
his request was most likely to be followed if

94
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,180
he touched a woman's forearm for one to two seconds.

95
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,960
This could be because tactile contact is associated with dominance.

96
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,680
Later, when the women were asked to complete a survey about their experience,

97
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,480
a high score of dominance was associated with the tactile contact!

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,100
And that's our list.

99
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,660
Hopefully this can help you in the dating world.

100
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,880
