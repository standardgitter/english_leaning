1
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:08,266
Have you experienced déjà vu?

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,540
It's that shadowy /ˈʃædəʊɪ 朦胧的/ feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar.

3
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:15,527
A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember.

4
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:18,335
The world moves like a ballet /ˈbæleɪ/
you've choreographed /ˈkɒrɪəˌɡrɑːf 编舞/,

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,836
but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,376
because you've never eaten here before.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,305
This is the first time you've had clams /klæm 蛤/,

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:26,737
so what's going on?

9
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,462
Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation /ˌɛkspləˈneɪʃən/ for déjà vu.

10
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:33,112
The experience is brief
and occurs without notice,

11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:36,686
making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,069
Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them --

13
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:41,199
this could take years.

14
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:43,341
It has no physical manifestations /ˌmænɪfeˈsteɪʃən 迹象/

15
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:44,553
and in studies,

16
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,543
it's described by the subject
as a sensation /sɛnˈseɪʃən 知觉/ or feeling.

17
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,389
Because of this lack of hard evidence,

18
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,382
there's been a surplus /ˈsɜrˌplʌs 过剩的/
of speculation /ˌspɛkjʊˈleɪʃən 推测/ over the years.

19
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:54,724
Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu

20
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:57,059
as a French term meaning "already seen,"

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:00,441
more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon.

22
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:04,738
Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive /ˈkɒɡnɪtɪv 认识的/ psychology

23
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:06,641
narrow down the field of prospects /prɔspekt 预期/.

24
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:09,704
Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent /ˈprɛvələnt 流行的/ theories,

25
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:11,806
using the same
restaurant setting for each.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,734
First up is dual /ˈdjuːəl 双数/ processing.

27
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:14,762
We'll need an action.

28
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,371
Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray /treɪ 托盘/ of dishes.

29
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,587
As the scene unfolds,

30
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,691
your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry /ˈflɜri 慌张 一阵风/ of information:

31
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,207
the waiter's flailing arms,

32
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:24,249
his cry for help,

33
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:25,751
the smell of pasta /ˈpæstə/.

34
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,870
Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways

35
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:31,289
and is processed into a single moment.

36
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:33,866
Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync /sɪŋk 同步/.

37
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,250
However, this theory asserts /əˈsə:t 断言/

38
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:37,996
that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,297
in information from one of these pathways.

40
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,798
The difference in arrival times

41
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:44,179
causes the brain to interpret /ɪnˈtɜːprɪt 解释/
the late information

42
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,742
as a separate event.

43
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:48,018
When it plays
over the already-recorded moment,

44
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,759
it feels as if it's happened before

45
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:51,980
because, in a sense, it has.

46
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:55,349
Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past

47
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:57,403
rather than a mistake in the present /ˈprɛzənt/.

48
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,237
This is the hologram /ˈhɒləˌɡræm 全息图/ theory,

49
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:01,530
and we'll use that tablecloth /ˈteɪbəlklɒθ/
to examine it.

50
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,348
As you scan its squares,

51
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,267
a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain.

52
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,487
According to the theory,

53
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,202
this is because memories are stored

54
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:10,604
in the form of holograms /ˈhɒləˌɡræm 全息图/,

55
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:11,719
and in holograms,

56
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:14,200
you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture.

57
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:17,252
Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past,

58
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,991
maybe from your grandmother's house.

59
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:22,837
However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's,

60
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,830
your brain has summoned /ˈsʌmən 召见/ up the old memory

61
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,448
without identifying it.

62
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:29,796
This leaves you stuck /stʌk 陷入/ with familiarity,
but no recollection.

63
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,968
Although you've never been
in this restaurant,

64
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:35,306
you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it.

65
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,601
Now, look at this fork.

66
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,015
Are you paying attention?

67
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,144
Our last theory is divided attention,

68
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:41,988
and it states /steɪt 陈述/ that déjà vu occurs

69
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,430
when our brain subliminally /sʌbˈlɪmɪnəlɪ 潜在意识地/
takes in an environment

70
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:47,180
while we're distracted /dɪˈstræktɪd 思想不集中的/
by one particular object.

71
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:48,490
When our attention returns,

72
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,324
we feel as if we've been here before.

73
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,452
For example, just now
you focused on the fork

74
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,112
and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter.

75
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,430
Although your brain has been
recording everything

76
00:02:57,454 --> 00:02:58,694
in your peripheral /pəˈrɪfərəl 次要的/ vision,

77
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,933
it's been doing so
below conscious awareness.

78
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:03,300
When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork,

79
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,707
you think you've been here before
because you have,

80
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,355
you just weren't paying attention.

81
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,729
While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu,

82
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:13,005
none of them propose /prəˈpəʊz 提议/ to be
the conclusive /kənˈkluːsɪv 决定性的/ source

83
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,142
of the phenomenon.

84
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,546
Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers /inˈventə 发明家/

85
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,348
to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting /fliːt 转瞬即逝的 / moment,

86
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,403
we can study the moment ourselves.

87
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:25,480
After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts,

88
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,319
so why can't one be yours?

89
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,703
The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it.

90
00:03:30,727 --> 00:03:32,114
Have you been distracted?

91
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:34,235
Is there a familiar object somewhere?

92
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,314
Is your brain just acting slow?

93
00:03:36,338 --> 00:00:00,000
Or is it something else?
