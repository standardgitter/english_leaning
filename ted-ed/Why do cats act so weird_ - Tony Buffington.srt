1
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:09,098
Why do cats do that?

2
00:00:12,568 --> 00:00:14,375
They're cute, they're lovable,

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:19,847
and judging by the 26 billions views
of over 2 million YouTube videos

4
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:21,068
of them pouncing /paʊns 猛扑/,

5
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:21,975
bouncing /baʊns 跳跃的/,

6
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:22,841
climbing,

7
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:23,639
cramming /kræm 塞满/,

8
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,540
stalking /stɔːk 潜近/,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,290
clawing /klɔː 爪抓/,

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,031
chattering /ˈtʃætə 唠叨/,

11
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:27,083
and purring /pɜː 猫 呼噜声/,

12
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,921
one thing is certain:

13
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:32,041
cats are very entertaining /ˌentəˈteɪnɪŋ  令人愉快的/.

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,328
These somewhat strange feline /ˈfiːlaɪn  猫科动物/ behaviors,

15
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:36,392
both amusing /əˈmjuːz 使愉快/ and baffling /ˈbæfl 令人困惑/,

16
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:40,576
leave many of us asking,
"Why do cats do that?"

17
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:45,983
Throughout time, cats were simultaneously /ˌsɪmlˈteɪniəsli 同时地/
solitary /ˈsɒlətri 独居者/ predators /ˈpredətə/ of smaller animals

18
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:49,198
and prey for larger carnivores /ˈkɑːnɪˌvɔː 食肉动物/.

19
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:50,784
As both predator and prey,

20
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,609
survival of their species depended
on crucial /ˈkruːʃəl 至关重要的/ instinctual /in'stiŋktʃuəl 本能的/ behaviors

21
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:00,635
which we still observe in wild 
and domestic cats today.

22
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:04,973
While the feline /ˈfiːlaɪn  猫科动物/ actions of your house cat
Grizmo might seem perplexing /pəˈpleksɪŋ 费解的/,

23
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,060
in the wild, these same behaviors,

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,188
naturally bred into cats 
for millions of years,

25
00:01:10,188 --> 00:01:13,377
would make Grizmo a super cat.

26
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:18,108
Enabled by their unique muscular /ˈmʌskjʊlə 肌肉的/ structure
and keen /kiːn 敏锐的/ balancing abilities,

27
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:22,263
cats climbed to high vantage /ˈvɑːntɪdʒ 优势/ points
to survey their territory

28
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:24,831
and spot prey in the wild.

29
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:29,155
Grizmo doesn't need these particular
skills to find and hunt down dinner

30
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,887
in her food bowl today,

31
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:34,357
but instinctually /ɪnˈstɪŋktʃʊəlɪ 本能地/, viewing the living room
from the top of the bookcase

32
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:37,911
is exactly what she has evolved to do.

33
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:44,122
As wild predators, cats are opportunistic /ˌɒpətjʊˈnɪstɪk 机会主义的/
and hunt whenever prey is available.

34
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,980
Since most cat prey are small,

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,651
cats in the wild needed to eat 
many times each day,

36
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,991
and use a stalk /stɔːk 追踪/, pounce /paʊns 猛扑/, kill, eat
strategy to stay fed.

37
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,862
This is why Grizmo prefers to chase
and pounce on little toys

38
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:02,860
and eat small meals over the course
of the day and night.

39
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,141
Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny
spaces in their natural environments,

40
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:12,541
so one explanation /ˌɛkspləˈneɪʃən/ for Grizmo's propensity /prəˈpɛnsɪtɪ 习性/
to reach into containers and openings

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,436
is that she is compelled /kəmˈpɛl 强迫/ by 
the same curiosity /ˌkjʊərɪˈɒsɪtɪ/

42
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:24,361
that helped ensure the continuation /kənˌtɪnjʊˈeɪʃən/ of
her species /ˈspiːʃiːz 物种/ for millions of years before.

43
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:30,181
In the wild, cats needed sharp claws
for climbing, hunting, and self-defense.

44
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,778
Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces
kept them conditioned and ready,

45
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,901
helped stretch /strɛtʃ 有弹性的/ their back and leg muscles,

46
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,321
and relieve some stress, too.

47
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:41,451
So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch /kaʊtʃ 长沙发椅/,

48
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:42,287
chair,

49
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,272
ottoman /ˈɒtəmən 软垫凳 土耳其人/,

50
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,017
pillows /ˈpɪləʊ 枕头/,

51
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:44,794
curtains /ˈkɜːtən 窗帘/,

52
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,499
and everything else 
you put in her environment.

53
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:52,134
She's ripping /rɪp 撕/ these things to shreds
and keeping her claws in tip-top shape

54
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:57,763
because this is exactly what her ancestors
did in order to survive.

55
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:59,506
As animals that were preyed upon,

56
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,883
cats evolved to not get caught,

57
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:06,195
and in the wild, the cats that were 
the best at avoiding predators thrived /θraɪv 繁荣/.

58
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,651
So at your house today,

59
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:11,449
Grizmo is an expert /ˈɛkspɜːt/
at squeezing /skwiːz 挤压/ into small spaces

60
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,663
and seeking out and hiding
in unconventional /ˌʌnkənˈvenʃənəl 非传统的/ spots.

61
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:19,727
It also explains why she prefers
a clean and odor/ˈəʊdə 气味 名声/-free litter box.

62
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,388
That's less likely to give away 
her location to any predators

63
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:26,573
that may be sniffing around nearby.

64
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,859
Considering everything 
we do know about cats,

65
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,789
it seems that one of their most 
predominate /prɪˈdɒmɪˌneɪt 主宰/ behaviors

66
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:34,292
is still one of the most mysterious /mɪˈstɪərɪəs/.

67
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,623
Cats may purr for any number of reasons,

68
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:38,809
such as happiness,

69
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:39,838
stress,

70
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,131
and hunger.

71
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,726
But curiously, 
the frequency of their purrs,

72
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,466
between 25 and 150 hertz /hɜːts HZ/,

73
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:51,292
is within a range that can promote /prəˈməʊt/
tissue regeneration /rɪˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃən 再生/.

74
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:54,777
So while her purring makes Grizmo
an excellent /ˈɛksələnt 出色的/ nap /næp 小睡/ companion /kəmˈpænjən 同伴/,

75
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:00,118
it is also possible that her purr
is healing /hiːl 治愈/ her muscles and bones,

76
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,265
and maybe even yours, too.

77
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,627
They developed through time

78
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:07,752
as both solitary /ˈsɒlɪtərɪ 独居的/ predators 
that hunted and killed to eat,

79
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:12,063
and stealthy /ˈstelθɪ 鬼鬼祟祟的/ prey that hid
and escaped to survive.

80
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:15,245
So cats today retain many 
of the same instincts /instiŋkt 本能/

81
00:04:15,245 --> 00:04:19,686
that allowed them to thrive in the wild
for millions of years.

82
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:23,512
This explains some of their seemingly
strange behaviors.

83
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,093
To them, our homes are their jungles.

84
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,961
But if this is the case, 
in our own cat's eyes,

85
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,442
who are we?

86
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:34,007
Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with
them for resources?

87
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:38,545
Terribly stupid predators they're able
to outsmart /ˌaʊtˈsmɑːt 比…更聪明/ every day?

88
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,989
Or maybe they think we're the prey.
