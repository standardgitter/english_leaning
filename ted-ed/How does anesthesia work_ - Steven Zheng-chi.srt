1
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:07,883
How does anesthesia /ˌænɪsˈθiːzɪə 麻醉/ work
If you've had surgery /ˈsɜːdʒərɪ/,

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,116
you might remember starting to count
backwards from ten,

3
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,368
nine,

4
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,461
eight,

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:18,853
and then waking up with the surgery
already over before you even got to five.

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,968
And it might seem like you were asleep,
but you weren't.

7
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:23,844
You were under anesthesia /ˌænɪsˈθiːzɪə 麻醉/,

8
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,636
which is much more complicated.

9
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,665
You were unconscious /ʌnˈkɒnʃəs 无意识/,

10
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,399
but you also couldn't move,

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,622
form memories,

12
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,225
or, hopefully, feel pain.

13
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:35,180
Without being able to block all those
processes at once,

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,060
many surgeries would be 
way too traumatic /trɔːˈmætɪk 痛苦的；创伤的/ to perform.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,397
Ancient medical texts from Egypt,
Asia and the Middle East

16
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:44,810
all describe early anesthetics /ˌænɪsˈθɛtɪk 麻醉剂/

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,927
containing things like opium /ˈəʊpɪəm 鸦片/ poppy /pɔpi 罂粟/,

18
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:48,309
mandrake /ˈmændreɪk 欧茄参/ fruit,

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,977
and alcohol.

20
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:52,188
Today, anesthesiologists /ˌænɪsˌθiːzɪˈɒlədʒɪst/ often combine

21
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:56,142
regional, inhalational /ˌɪnhəˈleɪʃənəl 吸入的/
and intravenous /ˌɪntrəˈviːnəs 静脉注射/ agents

22
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,831
to get the right balance for a surgery.

23
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:03,111
Regional /区域的/ anesthesia /ˌænɪsˈθiːzɪə/ blocks pain signals
from a specific part of the body

24
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,908
from getting to the brain.

25
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:10,139
Pain and other messages travel through
the nervous system as electrical impulses.

26
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:14,388
Regional anesthetics work by setting up
an electrical barricade /ˈbærɪˌkeɪd 路障 障碍物/.

27
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:18,271
They bind to the proteins 
in neurons' /ˈnjʊərəʊn 神经元/ cell membranes /ˈmɛmbreɪn 膜/

28
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,906
that let charged particles /ˈpɑːtɪkəl 微粒/ in and out,

29
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,987
and lock out positively /ˈpɒzɪtɪvlɪ 明确地/ charged particles.

30
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:26,973
One compound that does this is cocaine /koʊˈkeɪn  可卡因/,

31
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:29,896
whose painkilling effects 
were discovered by accident

32
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:33,999
when an ophthalmology /ˌɒfθælˈmɒlədʒɪ 眼科学/ intern /ˈɪnˌtɜrn 实习生/
got some on his tongue /tʌŋ/.

33
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:37,021
It's still occasionally used 
as an anesthetic,

34
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,430
but many of the more common
regional anesthetics

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,351
have a similar chemical structure
and work the same way.

36
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,180
But for major surgeries where you need
to be unconscious,

37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,483
you'll want something that acts
on the entire nervous system,

38
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,316
including the brain.

39
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:54,070
That's what inhalational /ˌɪnhəˈleɪʃənəl 吸入的/ anesthetics do.

40
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,594
In Western medicine, diethyl /daiˈeθil 二乙基/ ether /ˈiːθə 醚/
was the first common one.

41
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,384
It was best known as a recreational drug

42
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:05,464
until doctors started to realize that
people sometimes didn't notice

43
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:08,298
injuries they received 
under the influence /ˈɪnflʊəns 影响/.

44
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:12,444
In the 1840s, they started sedating /sɪˈdeɪt 给…服镇静剂/
patients with ether /ˈiːθə 醚/

45
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:15,332
during dental extractions /ɪkˈstrækʃən 抽出/ and surgeries.

46
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:19,149
Nitrous /ˈnaɪtrəs 氮的/ oxide /ˈɒksaɪd 氧化物/ became popular
in the decades that followed

47
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,826
and is still used today.

48
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:25,007
although ether /ˈiːθə 醚/ derivatives /dɪˈrɪvətɪv 衍生物/, 
like sevoflurane /sevəˈfluərein 七氟烷/, are more common.

49
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:30,138
Inhalational /ˌɪnhəˈleɪʃənəl 吸入的/ anesthesia is usually 
supplemented /sʌplimənt 补遗/ with intravenous /ˌɪntrəˈviːnəs 静脉注射/ anesthesia,

50
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:32,996
which was developed in the 1870s.

51
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:36,150
Common intravenous /ˌɪntrəˈviːnəs 静脉注射/ agents include
sedatives /ˈsɛdətɪv 镇静剂/, like propofol /丙酚/,

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,884
which induce unconsciousness,

53
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:42,188
and opioids /ˈəʊpɪˌɔɪd 类鸦片药物/, like fentanyl /ˈfentəˌnaɪl 芬太尼/, 
which reduce pain.

54
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:44,836
These general anesthetics 
also seem to work

55
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:47,907
by affecting electrical signals
in the nervous system.

56
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:51,754
Normally, the brain's electrical signals
are a chaotic chorus /ˈkɔːrəs 合唱/

57
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,126
as different parts of the brain
communicate with each other.

58
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:58,693
That connectivity keeps you awake
and aware.

59
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,426
But as someone becomes anesthetized,

60
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:03,549
those signals become calmer /kɑːm 镇定/
and more organized,

61
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:05,657
suggesting that different 
parts of the brain

62
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:08,164
aren't talking to each other anymore.

63
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:12,800
There's a lot we still don't know
about exactly how this happens.

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,771
Several common anesthetics bind to
the GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons /ˈnjʊərəʊn/.

65
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,598
They hold the gateway open,

66
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,030
letting negatively charged particles /ˈpɑːtɪkəl 微粒/
flow into the cell.

67
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,241
Negative charge builds up
and acts like a log  jam /dʒæm 堵塞/ 木头塞子,

68
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,842
keeping the neuron from transmitting
electrical signals.

69
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:35,444
The nervous system has lots
of these gated channels,

70
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,349
controlling pathways for movement,

71
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:38,419
memory,

72
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,779
and consciousness.

73
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,864
Most anesthetics probably 
act on more than one,

74
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,276
and they don't act on 
just the nervous system.

75
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,461
Many anesthetics also affect the heart,

76
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,386
lungs,

77
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,417
and other vital organs.

78
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,022
Just like early anesthetics,

79
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:55,586
which included familiar poisons like
hemlock /ˈhemˌlɒk 铁杉/ and aconite /ækənait 乌头/,

80
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:58,155
modern drugs can 
have serious /ˈsɪərɪəs 严重的/ side effects.

81
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,298
So an anesthesiologist has to mix
just the right balance of drugs

82
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:04,997
to create all the features of anesthesia,

83
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:08,019
while carefully monitoring
the patient's vital signs,

84
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,876
and adjusting the drug mixture as needed.

85
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,031
Anesthesia is complicated,

86
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,607
but figuring out how to use it

87
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:18,849
allowed for the development 
of new and better surgical techniques.

88
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:23,460
Surgeons could learn how to routinely /ruːˈtiːnlɪ 常规地/
and safely perform C-sections,

89
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,167
reopen blocked arteries /ˈɑːtərɪ 动脉/,

90
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,550
replace damaged livers and kidneys /ˈkɪdnɪ 肾脏/,

91
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,407
and many other life-saving operations.

92
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:33,970
And each year, new anesthesia techniques
are developed

93
00:04:33,970 --> 00:00:00,000
that will ensure more and more patients
survive the trauma /ˈtrɔːmə 痛苦/ of surgery.
