1
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:11,936
In 1898, Marie /mə'ri:/ and Pierre /pi'ɛə/ Curie /ˈkjʊəri/
discovered radium /ˈreɪdiəm/.

2
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:14,005
Claimed to have restorative /rɪˈstɔːrətɪv 滋补品；兴奋剂  / properties /ˈprɒpətɪ 特性/,

3
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,786
radium was added to toothpaste /ˈtuːθˌpeɪst 牙膏/,

4
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:16,657
medicine,

5
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:17,418
water,

6
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,615
and food.

7
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,486
A glowing /ɡləʊ （无火焰地）发光/, luminous /ˈluːmɪnəs 发光的/ green,

8
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,007
it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry.

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,297
It wasn't until the mid-20th century

10
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:30,265
we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element /ˈelɪmənt/

11
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:32,956
outweighed /ˌaʊtˈweɪ 比…重要/ its visual benefits.

12
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:35,876
Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment /ˈpɪɡmənt 颜料/ that historically /hɪˈstɒrɪkli/

13
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:38,585
seemed harmless or useful

14
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:40,535
but turned out to be deadly.

15
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:44,037
That lamentable /ˈlæməntəbəl 使人惋惜的/ distinction /dɪˈstɪŋkʃən 区分/ includes
a trio /ˈtriːəʊ 三件套/ of colors and pigments /ˈpɪɡmənt 颜料/

16
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:47,235
that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make:

17
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:48,116
white,

18
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:48,817
green,

19
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,726
and orange.

20
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:53,777
Our story begins with white.

21
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:56,167
As far back as the 4th century BCE,

22
00:00:56,167 --> 00:01:01,397
the Ancient Greeks treated lead /li:d/ to make
the brilliant /ˈbrɪljənt 有才智的/ white pigment we know today.

23
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:02,309
The problem?

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,938
In humans, lead is directly absorbed /əbˈsɔːb/
into the body

25
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,368
and distributed /dɪˈstrɪbjuːt/ to the blood,

26
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:08,217
soft tissues,

27
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,568
and mineralized /'mɪnrəl,aɪz 使矿物化/ tissues.

28
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:11,917
Once in the nervous /ˈnɜːvəs/ system,

29
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,177
lead mimics /ˈmɪmɪk 模拟的/ and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium /ˈkælsɪəm/,

30
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,767
causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities

31
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,079
to high blood pressure.

32
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,578
Yet the practice  /ˈpɑːtɪkəl 微粒/
of using this toxic /ˈtɒksɪk/ pigment

33
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:26,670
continued across time and cultures.

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,858
Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera /ˈtempərə 蛋彩画/ paint

35
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,908
until the 19th century /ˈsentʃəri/.

36
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:37,019
To make their paint, artists would grind /ɡraɪnd 磨碎/
a block of lead into powder,

37
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,088
exposing highly toxic dust particles /ˈpɑːtɪkəl 微粒/.

38
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:44,288
The pigment's liberal /ˈlɪbərəl 自由的/ use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic /ˈkɒlɪk 腹绞痛/,

39
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:47,528
or what we'd now call lead poisoning.

40
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:50,198
Artists who worked with lead complained
of palsys /ˈpɔːlzi 麻痹/,

41
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:51,159
melancholy /ˈmɛlənkəlɪ  忧郁/,

42
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,039
coughing /kɒf/,

43
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,140
enlarged /ɪnˈlɑːdʒ/ retinas /ˈrɛtɪnə 视网膜 /,

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,758
and even blindness.

45
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:59,929
But lead white's density /ˈdɛnsɪtɪ 密度/, opacity /əʊˈpæsɪtɪ 不透明/,
and warm tone /təʊn  色调/

46
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:04,771
were irresistible /ˌɪrɪˈzɪstɪbəl 无法抗拒的 / to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists /ɪmˈpreʃənɪst/.

47
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,402
Its glow /ɡləʊ/ couldn't be matched,

48
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:11,659
and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s.

49
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,271
As bad as all that sounds,

50
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,770
white's dangerous effects 
pale /peɪl 苍白的/ in comparison /kəmˈpærɪsn/

51
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,191
to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green.

52
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:24,110
Two synthetic /sɪnˈθɛtɪk 合成/ greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,831
were first introduced in the 18th century.

54
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:30,020
They were far more vibrant /ˈvaɪbrənt 充满生气的/ and flashy /ˈflæʃi 浮华的/

55
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,241
than the relatively /ˈrelətɪvli/ dull /dʌl 沉闷的/ greens
made from natural pigments,

56
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,620
so they quickly became popular choices
for paint

57
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,630
as well as dye /daɪ 染料/ for textiles /ˈtekstaɪl/,

58
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,630
wallpaper,

59
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,473
soaps /səʊp/,

60
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,500
cake decorations,

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,290
toys,

62
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,071
candy,

63
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,661
and clothing.

64
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,232
These green pigments were made from
a compound /ˈkɒmpaʊnd/ called

65
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,641
cupric /kju:prik 二价铜的/ hydrogen arsenic /ˈɑːsnɪk 砷 /.

66
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,509
In humans, exposure /ɪkˈspəʊʒə 暴露/ to arsenic /ˈɑːsnɪk 砷 /

67
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:53,759
can damage the way cells 
communicate and function.

68
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,239
And high levels of arsenic /ˈɑːsnɪk 砷 / have been
directly linked

69
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,600
to cancer and heart disease.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,421
As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned,

71
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:06,582
and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed /kəˈlæps/

72
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:09,622
from exposure to arsenic on their skin.

73
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,541
Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms,

74
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,852
and it's even been speculated /ˈspɛkjʊˌleɪt 猜测/ that
Napoleon /pəuliən/ died from slow arsenic poisoning

75
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:20,851
from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom.

76
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:24,370
The intense toxicity /tɒkˈsɪsəti 毒性/ of these green
stayed under wraps /ræp/

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,153
until the arsenic recipe /ˈrɛsɪpɪ/ was published
in 1822.

78
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:32,022
And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide /ɪnˈsɛktɪˌsaɪd 杀虫剂/.

79
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:36,403
Synthetic /sɪnˈθetɪk 合成的/ green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use,

80
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:39,833
but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity /ˌreɪdiəʊækˈtɪvəti 放射性/.

81
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,093
Another color did, though - orange.

82
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:47,293
Before World War II, it was common /ˈkɒmən/
for manufacturers of ceramic /səˈræmɪk 陶瓷的/ dinnerware

83
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,443
to use uranium /juˈreɪniəm/ oxide /ˈɒksaɪd 氧化物/ in colored glazes /ɡleɪz 釉/.

84
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:52,974
The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges,

85
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:57,234
which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted /ɪˈmɪt 散发/.

86
00:03:57,234 --> 00:04:01,693
Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware /ˌʌnəˈweə 不知不觉地/ of until the late 1800s,

87
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:06,460
let alone /əˈləʊn/ the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later.

88
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,754
During World War II,

89
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:12,583
the U.S. government confiscated /ˈkɒnfɪˌskeɪt 没收/ all uranium
for use in bomb development.

90
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:17,805
However, the atomic /əˈtɒmɪk/ energy commission
relaxed /rɪˈlækst/ these restrictions in 1959,

91
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:22,444
and depleted /dɪˈpliːt 耗尽/ uranium returned to ceramics /sɪˈræmɪk 陶瓷制品/
and glass factory floors.

92
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,395
Orange dishes made during 
the next decade

93
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:28,264
may still have some hazardous /ˈhæzədəs 有危险的/ qualities
on their surfaces to this day.

94
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:33,045
Most notably /显著地/, vintage /ˈvɪntɪdʒ 葡萄酒/ fiestaware /fiˈestə 节日/
reads positive for radioactivity.

95
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:36,975
And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk

96
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,584
if they're on a shelf,

97
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:44,159
the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them.

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,034
Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic /sɪnˈθetɪk 合成的/ food dyes /daɪ 染料/,

99
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:55,034
our scientific understanding has helped us
prune /pruːn 修剪 删除/ hazardous /ˈhæzədəs 有危险的/ colors out of our lives.
