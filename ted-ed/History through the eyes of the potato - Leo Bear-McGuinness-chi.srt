1
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:08,128
Baked or fried,

2
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:09,601
boiled /bɔɪld/ or roasted,

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,581
as chips or fries.

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:15,198
At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato.

5
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,660
Delicious, for sure,

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,967
but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history

7
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:26,365
than just that of the dietary /ˈdaɪətərɪ 膳食de/ staple /ˈsteɪpəl 主食 订书钉/
we have come to know and love today.

8
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,806
Without the potato,

9
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:31,379
our modern civilization 
might not exist at all.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,141
8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop /əˈtɒp 在顶上/ the Andes,

11
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:38,755
ancient /ˈeɪnʃənt/ Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato.

12
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,464
Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates /ˌkɑːbəʊˈhaɪdreɪts 碳水化合物食品/,

13
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:44,640
as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals /ˈmɪnərəl 矿物/,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,363
potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan /ˈɪŋkən 印加人/ working class

15
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:52,060
as they built and farmed 
their terraced /ˈtɛrəs 梯田/ fields,

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,698
mined the Rocky Mountains,

17
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,492
and created the sophisticated /səˈfistikeit 弄复杂/ civilization
of the great Incan Empire /ˈempaɪə/.

18
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,211
But considering how vital /ˈvaɪtəl 必不可少的/ they were
to the Incan people,

19
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,623
when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes

20
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:05,940
first brought potatoes to Europe,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,096
the spuds /spʌd 马铃薯/ were duds /dʌd 无用的/.

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,860
Europeans simply didn't want to eat

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,229
what they considered dull /dʌl 枯燥乏味/ and tasteless
oddities /ˈɒdɪtɪ 古怪/ from a strange new land,

24
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,279
too closely related to the deadly
nightshade /ˈnaɪtˌʃeɪd 龙葵属植物/ plant belladonna /ˌbɛləˈdɒnə 颠茄/ for comfort.

25
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,853
So instead of consuming them,

26
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:24,901
they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants.

27
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:28,234
More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on

28
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,910
as a major food source throughout Europe,

29
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:31,829
though even then,

30
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,855
it was predominantly /prɪˈdɒmɪnəntlɪ 主要地/ eaten 
by the lower classes.

31
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:37,192
However, beginning around 1750,

32
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,896
and thanks at least in part

33
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:42,913
to the wide availability /əveiləbiliti/
of inexpensive and nutritious /njuːˈtrɪʃəs/ potatoes,

34
00:01:42,913 --> 00:01:45,675
European peasants  /ˈpezənt 农民/
with greater food security

35
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:47,218
no longer found themselves

36
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:51,712
at the mercy /ˈmɜːsɪ 宽恕/ of the regularly 
occurring grain /ɡreɪn 谷物/ famines /ˈfæmɪn 饥荒/ of the time,

37
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,255
and so their populations steadily /stedəli 稳定地/ grew.

38
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:57,366
As a result, the British, Dutch /dʌtʃ 荷兰人/
and German Empires

39
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:02,340
rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers /ˈleɪbərə 工人/, and soldiers,

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,422
thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion /dəˈmɪnjən 主权，统治/.

41
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:10,282
However, not all European countries
sprouted /spraʊt 发芽/ empires.

42
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,423
After the Irish /ˈaɪrɪʃ 爱尔兰/ adopted the potato,

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,807
their population dramatically increased,

44
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,174
as did their dependence on the tuber /ˈtjuːbə 块茎/
as a major food staple /ˈsteɪpəl/.

45
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,268
But then disaster struck /strʌk 打击/.

46
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:23,797
From 1845 to 1852,

47
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:28,782
potato blight /blaɪt 疫病；枯病/ disease ravaged /ˈrævɪdʒ 重创/ 
the majority of Ireland's /ˈaɪələnd/ potato crop,

48
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,225
leading to the Irish Potato Famine /ˈfæmɪn 饥荒/,

49
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:34,308
one of the deadliest famines /ˈfæmɪn 饥荒/
in world history.

50
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,422
Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death,

51
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:41,273
and 2 million more 
left their homes behind.

52
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:44,035
But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato.

53
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,801
The crop eventually recovered,

54
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:49,106
and Europe's population,
especially the working classes,

55
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,314
continued to increase.

56
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,601
Aided by the influx /ˈɪnˌflʌks 汇集/ of Irish migrants /ˈmaɪɡrənt/,

57
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:58,223
Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population

58
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:01,242
who were capable of manning /ˈmænɪŋ 配备人员/
the emerging factories

59
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:06,185
that would bring about our modern world
via /ˈvaɪə/ the Industrial Revolution.

60
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,819
So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato.

61
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,388
Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened?

62
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:15,121
Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies /ælaiz/

63
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:19,004
without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops?

64
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:20,709
Would it even have started?

65
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,371
When you think about it like this,

66
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:27,387
many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially /ˈpɑːʃəli 部分地/ attributed /əˈtrɪbjuːt 属性/

67
00:03:27,387 --> 00:00:00,000
to the simple spud /spʌd 马铃薯/
from the Peruvian /pəˈruːviən 秘鲁人/ hilltops.
