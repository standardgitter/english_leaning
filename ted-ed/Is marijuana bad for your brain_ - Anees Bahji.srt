1
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:13,144
In 1970, marijuana /ˌmærɪˈwɑːnə/ was classified as a 
schedule 1 drug in the United States:

2
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,737
the strictest designation /ˌdezɪɡˈneɪʃən 指定/ possible,

3
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:20,779
meaning it was completely illegal and had 
no recognized medical uses.

4
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,529
For decades, this view persisted

5
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:28,538
and set back research on the 
drug's mechanisms /ˈmɛkəˌnɪzəm 机理/ and effects.

6
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:33,028
Today, marijuana/ˌmærɪˈwɑːnə/’s therapeutic /ˌθɛrəˈpjuːtɪk 有疗效的/ benefits 
are widely acknowledged,

7
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:38,482
and some nations have legalized medical 
use or are moving in that direction.

8
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:44,081
But a growing recognition for marijuana’s 
medical value doesn’t answer the question:

9
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:49,095
is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain?

10
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:52,805
Marijuana acts on the body’s 
cannabinoid /kænəbinɔid 大麻素/ system,

11
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:56,445
which has receptors all over 
the brain and body.

12
00:00:56,445 --> 00:01:01,036
Molecules /ˈmɒlɪˌkjuːl 分子/ native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids /内源性大麻素/,

13
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:03,696
also act on these receptors.

14
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,471
We don’t totally understand the 
cannabinoid /kænəbinɔid 大麻素/ system,

15
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:12,137
but it has one feature that provides 
a big clue to its function.

16
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:15,887
Most neurotransmitters /ˌnjʊərəʊtrænzˈmɪtə 神经传递介质/ travel from 
one neuron /ˈnjʊərəʊn 神经元/ to the next

17
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:19,457
through a synapse /ˈsaɪnæps 神经键/ to propagate /ˈprɒpəˌɡeɪt  传播/ a message.

18
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:23,223
But endocannabinoids /内源性大麻素/ travel 
in the opposite direction.

19
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:26,716
When a message passes from the 
one neuron /ˈnjʊərəʊn 神经元/ to the next,

20
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:30,631
the receiving neuron releases 
endocannabinoids.

21
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:35,748
Those endocannabinoids travel backward 
to influence the sending neuron—

22
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:40,416
essentially giving it feedback from 
the receiving neuron.

23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:44,496
This leads scientists to believe that 
the endocannabinoid system

24
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:48,294
serves primarily to modulate /mɔdjuleit 调节/
other kinds of signals—

25
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:51,832
amplifying /ˈæmplɪˌfaɪ 扩大；详述/ some and diminishing /dɪˈmɪnɪʃ 减小/ others.

26
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:57,156
Feedback from endocannabinoids slows 
down rates of neural /ˈnjʊərəl 神经的/ signaling.

27
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:01,918
That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows 
down behavior or perception /pəˈsɛpʃən 知觉；感觉/, though.

28
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:05,978
For example, slowing down a 
signal that inhibits /ɪnˈhɪbɪt 禁止，抑制/ smell

29
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:09,652
could actually make smells more intense.

30
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:13,497
Marijuana contains two 
main active compounds /ˈkɒmpaʊnd 混合的/,

31
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:21,900
tetrahydrocannabinol /,tetrə,haidrəkə'næbinɔl 四氢大麻酚/ or THC, 
and cannabidiol /大麻二酚/, or CBD.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,605
THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive /ˌsaɪkəʊˈæktɪv  能作用于精神的/ effects

33
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,471
on behavior, cognition, and perception /pəˈsɛpʃən 洞察力 看法/,

34
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:35,413
while CBD is responsible for 
the non-psychoactive effects.

35
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,773
Like endocannabinoids,

36
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:43,361
THC slows down signaling by binding /baɪnd 绑/ 
to cannabinoid receptors.

37
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:48,324
But it binds to receptors all over 
this sprawling /sprɔːl  伸开手足躺/, diffuse /dɪˈfjuːz  扩散/ system at once,

38
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:52,294
whereas endocannabinoids are 
released in a specific place

39
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:55,221
in response to a specific stimulus /ˈstɪmjʊləs 刺激/.

40
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:59,761
This widespread activity coupled with 
the fact that the cannabinoid system

41
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,421
indirectly affects many other systems

42
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:06,450
means that each person’s particular 
brain chemistry, genetics,

43
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,989
and previous life experience largely 
determine how they experience the drug.

44
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,099
That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs

45
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,731
that produce their effects through one 
or a few specific pathways.

46
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:26,170
So the harmful effects, if any, vary 
considerably from person to person.

47
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,730
And while we don’t know how 
exactly how marijuana

48
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,213
produces specific harmful effects,

49
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:34,859
there are clear risk factors that 
can increase peoples’ likelihood

50
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:37,036
of experiencing them.

51
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:40,003
The clearest risk factor is age.

52
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:44,713
In people younger than 25, cannabinoid 
receptors are more concentrated

53
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:48,533
in the white matter than
in people over 25.

54
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,620
The white matter is involved in 
communication,

55
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,870
learning, memory, and emotions.

56
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,254
Frequent marijuana use can disrupt 
the development of white matter tracts /trækt 道/,

57
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:03,438
and also affect the brain’s ability to 
grow new connections.

58
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,091
This may damage long-term learning 
ability and problem solving.

59
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:12,902
For now, it’s unclear how severe /sɪˈvɪə 严重的/ this 
damage can be or whether it’s reversible.

60
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:17,769
And even among young people, the risk 
is higher the younger someone is—

61
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,515
much higher for a 15 year old than a 
22 year old, for instance.

62
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:27,112
Marijuana can also cause hallucinations /həˌluːsɪˈneɪʃən 幻觉/
or paranoid /ˈpærəˌnɔɪd 偏执狂患者；妄想症患者/ delusions /dɪˈluːʒən 欺骗/.

63
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:29,842
Known as marijuana-induced /ɪnˈdjuːsd 引起 感应的/  psychosis /saɪˈkəʊsɪs 精神病/,

64
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:33,845
these symptoms usually subside /səbˈsaɪd 减弱/
when a person stops using marijuana.

65
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,284
But in rare cases, psychosis 
doesn’t subside,

66
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:41,706
instead unmasking a persistent /pəˈsɪstənt 持续的/
psychotic /saɪˈkɒtɪk 精神病患者/ disorder.

67
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:46,246
A family history of psychotic disorders 
like schizophrenia /ˌskɪtsəʊˈfriːnɪə 精神分裂症/ is the clearest,

68
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:49,427
though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect.

69
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:53,955
Marijuana-induced psychosis is also 
more common among young adults,

70
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:56,469
though it’s worth noting that 
psychotic /saɪˈkɒtɪk 精神病患者/ disorders

71
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,199
usually surface in this age range anyway.

72
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,093
What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder

73
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,399
would have appeared without 
marijuana use—

74
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,989
whether marijuana use triggers it early,

75
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:12,243
is a catalyst /ˈkætəlɪst 催化剂；诱因/ for a tipping point /转折点/ that 
wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise,

76
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:15,964
or whether the reaction to 
marijuana is merely an indication

77
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:18,174
of an underlying disorder.

78
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:23,391
In all likelihood /ˈlaɪklɪˌhʊd 可能，可能性/, marijuana’s role varies
from person to person.

79
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:26,011
At any age, as with many other drugs,

80
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:31,208
the brain and body become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses,

81
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,108
meaning it takes more to 
achieve the same effects.

82
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,939
Fortunately, unlike many other drugs,

83
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,229
there’s no risk of fatal /ˈfeɪtəl 致命的/ overdose /ˈəʊvəˌdəʊs 过量服用 沉溺/ 
from marijuana,

84
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,204
and even heavy use doesn’t 
lead to debilitating /dɪˈbɪlɪˌteɪt 使虚弱，使衰弱/

85
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:48,273
or life-threatening withdrawal  /wɪðˈdrɔːəl 退出 撤走/ 
symptoms if use stops.

86
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:52,176
There are more subtle /ˈsʌtəl 稀薄的；微妙的/ forms of 
marijuana withdrawal, though,

87
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:56,851
including sleep disturbances /dɪˈstɜːbəns 干扰；打乱/, 
irritability /ˌɪrɪtəˈbɪlɪtɪ  易怒,过敏性,兴奋性/, and depressed mood,

88
00:05:56,851 --> 00:06:00,661
which pass within a few weeks 
of stopping use.

89
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,220
So is marijuana bad for your brain?

90
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,340
It depends who you are.

91
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,128
But while some risk factors are easy to 
identify, others aren’t well understood—

92
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:16,077
which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects,

93
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:19,777
even if you don’t have any of 
the known risk factors.
