1
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:09,444
A banker in London sends the latest stock info

2
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:12,459
to his colleagues /ˈkɒliːɡ/ in Hong Kong in less than a second.

3
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:14,759
With a single click, a customer in New York

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,854
orders electronics made in Beijing,

5
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:19,082
transported across the ocean within days

6
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,603
by cargo plane or container ship.

7
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:23,650
The speed and volume /ˈvɒljuːm 大量/ at which goods and information

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,486
move across the world today is unprecedented /ˈprɛsɪdənt 先例；惯例/ in history.

9
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:30,581
But global exchange itself is older than we think,

10
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:34,170
reaching back over 2,000 years along a 5,000 mile stretch /strɛtʃ 延伸/

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,521
known as the Silk Road.

12
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,065
The Silk Road wasn't actually a single road,

13
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:41,134
but a network of multiple /ˈmʌltɪpəl/ routes

14
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,494
that gradually /grædʒuəli 渐渐地/ emerged over centuries,

15
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:45,934
connecting to various settlements and to each other

16
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,311
thread by thread.

17
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:51,045
The first agricultural civilizations were isolated places

18
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,615
in fertile /ˈfɜːtaɪl 肥沃的/ river valleys /ˈvælɪ 山谷 溪谷/,

19
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:54,905
their travel impeded /ɪmˈpiːd  阻碍/ by surrounding geography /dʒɪˈɒɡrəfɪ/

20
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,521
and fear of the unknown.

21
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,744
But as they grew,

22
00:00:57,744 --> 00:01:00,541
they found that the arid /ˈærɪd 干旱的/ deserts and steps on their borders

23
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,868
were inhabited /ɪnˈhæbɪt 栖息/, not by the demons /ˈdiːmən 恶魔/ of folklore /ˈfəʊkˌlɔː 民间传说/,

24
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:05,233
but nomadic /nəʊˈmædɪk 游牧的/ tribes /traɪb 部落/ on horseback.

25
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,258
The Scythians, who ranged from Hungary to Mongolia,

26
00:01:08,258 --> 00:01:10,121
had come in contact with the civilizations of

27
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,129
Greece, Egypt, India and China.

28
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,517
These encounters were often less than peaceful.

29
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:17,891
But even through raids /reɪd 突袭；抢劫/ and warfare /ˈwɔːˌfɛə/,

30
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,719
as well as trade and protection of traveling merchants

31
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,256
in exchange for tariffs /tærif/,

32
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:25,775
the nomads /ˈnəʊmæd 游牧民/ began to spread goods, ideas and technologies

33
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:28,576
between cultures with no direct contact.

34
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,591
One of the most important strands /strænd 线,链/ of this growing web

35
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,160
was the Persian Royal Road,

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,993
completed by Darius the First in the 5th century BCE.

37
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:41,399
Stretching nearly 2,000 miles from the Tigris /ˈtaɪɡrɪs 底格里斯河/ River to the Aegean /iːˈdʒiːən 爱琴海/ Sea,

38
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:43,937
its regular relay /ˈriːleɪ  中继设备/ points allowed goods and messages

39
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,251
to travel at nearly 1/10 the time it would take a single traveler.

40
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:50,965
With Alexander /ˌælɪɡˈzɑːndə/ the Great's conquest /ˈkɒnkwest 征服/ of Persia,

41
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,699
and expansion into Central Asia through capturing cities like Samarkand,

42
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,994
and establishing new ones like Alexandria /ˌælɪɡˈzændrɪə/ Eschate,

43
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:01,563
the network of Greek, Egyptian /ɪˈdʒɪpʃən/, Persian and Indian culture and trade

44
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:04,455
extended farther east than ever before,

45
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:07,978
laying the foundations for a bridge between China and the West.

46
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:11,029
This was realized in the 2nd century BCE,

47
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,306
when an ambassador /æmˈbæsədə/ named Zhang Qian,

48
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,517
sent to negotiate with nomads /ˈnəʊmæd 游牧民/ in the West,

49
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,605
returned to the Han Emperor with tales /teɪl 传说/ of

50
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,709
sophisticated /səˈfɪstɪˌkeɪtɪd 老练的/ civilizations, prosperous /ˈprɒspərəs 繁荣的/ trade

51
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,909
and exotic /ɪɡˈzɒtɪk 异国的/ goods beyond the western borders.

52
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,313
Ambassadors /æmˈbæsədə/ and merchants were sent towards

53
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,943
Persia and India to trade silk and jade /dʒeɪd/ for horses and cotton,

54
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:32,864
along with armies to secure their passage /ˈpæsɪdʒ 通道/.

55
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,358
Eastern and western routes gradually linked together

56
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,323
into an integrated /ˈɪntɪˌɡreɪtɪd 整合的/ system spanning Eurasia /jʊəˈreɪʃə 欧亚大陆/,

57
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,240
enabling cultural and commercial exhange

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,506
farther than ever before.

59
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,736
Chinese goods made their way to Rome,

60
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,281
causing an outflow /ˈaʊtˌfləʊ 流出/ of gold that led to a ban on silk,

61
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,430
while Roman /ˈrəʊmən/ glassware was highly prized in China.

62
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,892
Military expeditions /ˌɛkspɪˈdɪʃən 远征.探险/ in Central Asia

63
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:57,267
also saw encounters between Chinese and Roman soldiers /ˈsəʊldʒə/.

64
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,547
Possibly even transmitting crossbow technology

65
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,812
to the Western world.

66
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,187
Demand for exotic /ɪɡˈzɒtɪk/ and foreign goods

67
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,389
and the profits they brought,

68
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:07,699
kept the strands /strænd 线/ of the Silk Road intact /ɪnˈtækt 完整无缺的/,

69
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,989
even as the Roman Empire disintegrated /dɪsˈɪntɪˌɡreɪt 分裂/

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,258
and Chinese dynasties rose and fell.

71
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,151
Even Mongolian hoards /hɔːd 贮藏/, known for pillage /ˈpɪlɪdʒ 掠夺/ and plunder /ˈplʌndə 抢劫/,

72
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,588
actively protected the trade routes, rather than disrupting them.

73
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:22,642
But along with commodities /kəˈmɒdɪtɪ 商品/, these routes also enabled

74
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:27,087
the movement of traditions, innovations, ideologies /ˌaɪdɪˈɒlədʒɪ 思想/ and languages.

75
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,644
Originating in India, Buddhism /ˈbʊdɪzəm 佛教/ migrated /maɪˈɡreɪt/ to China and Japan

76
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,989
to become the dominant religion there.

77
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,278
Islam /ˈɪzlɑːm/ spread from the Arabian /əˈreɪbɪən/ Peninsula /pɪˈnɪnsjʊlə/ into South Asia,

78
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:37,888
blending /blɛnd 混合/ with native beliefs

79
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,704
and leading to new faiths /feɪθ 信仰/, like Sikhism /ˈsiːkɪzəm 锡克教/.

80
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,427
And gunpowder made its way from China to the Middle East

81
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:48,258
forging /fɔːdʒ 锻造/ the futures of the Ottoman /ˈɒtəmən/, Safavid and Mughul Empires.

82
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:51,214
In a way, the Silk Road's success led to its own demise /dɪˈmaɪz 转让/

83
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:54,272
as new maritime /ˈmærɪˌtaɪm 海上的/ technologies, like the magnetic /mæɡˈnɛtɪk 有磁性的/ compass /ˈkʌmpəs 指南针/,

84
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:57,990
found their way to Europe, making long land routes obsolete /ˈɒbsəˌliːt 淘汰/.

85
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,622
Meanwhile, the collapse /kəˈlæps 倒塌/ of Mongol rule

86
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,032
was followed by China's withdrawal from international trade.

87
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:06,851
But even though the old routes and networks did not last,

88
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,936
they had changed the world forever

89
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,848
and there was no going back.

90
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,023
Europeans seeking new maritime /ˈmærɪˌtaɪm 海上的/ routes

91
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:15,639
to the riches they knew awaited in East Asia

92
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,380
led to the Age of Exploration /ˌɛkspləˈreɪʃən/

93
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,487
and expansion into Africa and the Americas.

94
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:24,286
Today, global interconnectedness shapes our lives like never before.

95
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:27,557
Canadian shoppers buy t-shirts made in Bangladesh /ˌbæŋɡləˈdeʃ 孟加拉国/,

96
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:30,500
Japanese audiences watch British television shows,

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,436
and Tunisians /tjuːˈnɪzɪən 突尼斯人/ use American software to launch a revolution.

98
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:38,577
The impact of globalization on culture and economy is indisputable /ˌɪndɪˈspjuːtəbəl 不容置疑的/.

99
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,563
But whatever its benefits and drawbacks /ˈdrɔːˌbæk 缺点/,

100
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:43,246
it is far from a new phenomenon.

101
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,501
And though the mountains, deserts and oceans

102
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:46,688
that once separated us

103
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:49,452
are now circumvented /ˌsɜːkəmˈvɛnt 规避/ through super sonic vehicles,

104
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:51,576
cross-continental /ˌkɒntɪˈnentəl/ communication cables,

105
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,789
and signals beamed through space

106
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,116
rather than caravans /ˈkærəˌvæn 旅行商队/ traveling for months,

107
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,863
none of it would have been possible

108
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,385
without the pioneering cultures

109
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,842
whose efforts created the Silk Road:

110
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:09,842
history's first world wide web.
