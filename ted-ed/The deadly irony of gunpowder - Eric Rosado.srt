1
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:11,690
The deadly irony/ˈaɪrənɪ  讽刺 反语 / of gunpowder, Everybody loves fireworks --

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,934
the lights, the colors,

3
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,497
and, of course, the big boom.

4
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:16,881
But the history of fireworks

5
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,084
isn't all hugs /hʌɡ 拥抱/  and celebrations.

6
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,471
Long before epic /ˈɛpɪk 史诗般的/ fireworks displays,

7
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:24,225
chemists in China invented the key ingredient /ɪnˈɡriːdɪənt 原料/ 

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,432
that propels /prəˈpɛl 推进；驱使/ those bright lights into the sky.

9
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:30,388
That invention was what we now call gunpowder.

10
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:32,766
Our story begins back in ancient/ˈeɪnʃənt/ China

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,342
in the mid-ninth century

12
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:36,186
where early Chinese alchemists /ˈælkəmɪst 炼金术士/

13
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,684
were trying to create a potion /ˈpəʊʃən 药水/ for immortality /ɪmɔːˈtælɪtɪ 不死；永生/.

14
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:42,733
Instead, what they created was a flammable /ˈflæməbəl 易燃的/  powder

15
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,159
that burned down many of their homes.

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,740
They quickly realized that this black powder,

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,277
which they called fire medicine,

18
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:51,518
was precisely /prɪˈsaɪslɪ 精确地/ the opposite /ˈɒpəzɪt 相反的 背道而驰/ of something 

19
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,326
that would make you live forever.

20
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:54,611
In these early days,

21
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:56,573
the Chinese hadn't yet figured out

22
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,508
how to make the powder explode;

23
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,263
it was simply very flammable /ˈflæməbəl 易燃的/,

24
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:01,518
and their armies used it

25
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:02,845
to make flaming arrows

26
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,384
and even a flame thrower /ˈθrəʊə 投掷者/.

27
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,224
But once they figured out the right proportions /prəˈpɔːʃən 比例/

28
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:08,391
of ingredients /ɪnˈɡriːdɪənt 原料/ to create a blast /blɑːst 爆炸/,

29
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,718
they began using the powder even more,

30
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:13,510
creating fireworks to keep evil /ˈiːvəl 邪恶/  spirits /ˈspɪrɪt 灵魂/ away

31
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,233
and bombs to defend /dɪˈfɛnd/ themselves

32
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,568
against Mongol/ˈmɒŋɡɒl/ invaders /ɪnˈveɪdə/.

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,769
It was these Mongols, most likely,

34
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,573
who spread the invention of gunpowder

35
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:22,981
across the world.

36
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:25,098
After fielding Chinese attacks,

37
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,352
they learned how to produce the powder themselves

38
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,320
and brought it with them

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,074
on their conquests/ˈkɒnkwest 征服/  in Persia /ˈpɜːʃə 波斯/  and India.

40
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:32,403
William of Rubruck,

41
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,241
a European ambassador/æmˈbæsədə 大使/ to the Mongols,

42
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,550
was likely responsible for bringing gunpowder

43
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,332
back to Europe around 1254.

44
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,770
From there, engineers and military inventors

45
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,498
created all kinds of destructive weapons.

46
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:47,167
From bombs to guns to cannons /ˈkænən 大炮/,

47
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,457
gunpowder left its mark on the world

48
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,180
in some pretty terrible ways,

49
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,986
in contrast /ˈkɒntrɑːst 对比/  to the beautiful marks

50
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,754
it can leave in the air.

51
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:56,254
So, how does black powder propel /prəˈpɛl 推进；驱使/

52
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:58,005
fireworks into the sky?

53
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,588
You might have seen old Westerns or cartoons /kɑːˈtuːn/

54
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,406
where a trail /treɪl 足迹/ of gunpowder is lit /lɪt light 的过去式/

55
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,646
and it leads to a large and obviously explosive /ɪkˈspləʊsɪv 炸药/  barrel /ˈbærəl 桶/.

56
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,418
Once the fire gets to the barrel,

57
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,924
a large boom occurs.

58
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,667
But why doesn't the trail /treɪl 足迹/ itself explode /ɪkˈspləʊd/?

59
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,646
The reason is that burning the powder

60
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:15,926
releases energy and gases.

61
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,530
While the trail is burning,

62
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,533
these are easily released into the surrounding air.

63
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,563
But when the gunpowder

64
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:23,417
is contained within the barrel,

65
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,398
the energy and gases cannot easily escape

66
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,983
and build up until

67
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,048
BOOM!

68
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,193
Firework canisters /ˈkænɪstə 盒子/ provide

69
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,374
a single, upward-facing outlet /ˈaʊtlɛt 排放口 电源插座/

70
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,666
to channel this explosive energy.

71
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,376
The wick /wɪk 灯芯/ ignites /ɪɡˈnaɪt 点燃/ the gunpowder

72
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,333
and the energy takes

73
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,288
the easiest exit from the canister /ˈkænɪstə 盒子/,

74
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:42,719
launching the firework high into the sky.

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,058
The flame then makes its way

76
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:45,675
through the firework's encasing /in'keisiŋ 罩子; 套子/

77
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,176
and the same reaction occurs

78
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:48,795
high above our heads.

79
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,509
So, while the Chinese alchemists /ˈælkəmɪst 炼金术士/

80
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,837
never found the compound /ˈkɒmpaʊnd 化合物/ for eternal /ɪˈtɜːnəl 不朽的/ life,

81
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,005
they did find something

82
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:56,503
that would go on to shape all of civilization,

83
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:57,606
something that has caused

84
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:59,592
many tragic /ˈtrædʒɪk 悲惨的/ moments in human history,

85
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,559
and yet still gives us hope

86
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,260
when we look up in celebration

87
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
at the colorful night sky.
