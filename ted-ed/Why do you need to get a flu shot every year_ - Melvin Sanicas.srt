1
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:12,310
All year long, researchers at hundreds
of hospitals around the world

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,019
collect samples from flu patients

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,179
and send them to top virology /vaɪˈrɒlədʒɪ 病毒学/ experts
with one goal:

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,268
to design the vaccine  /ˈvæksiːn 疫苗/
for the next flu season.

5
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:26,379
But why do we need a new one every year?

6
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:30,879
Vaccines /ˈvæksiːn 疫苗/ for diseases like mumps /mʌmps 流行性腮腺炎/
and rubella /ruːˈbɛlə 风疹/ offer a lifetime of protection

7
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,628
with two shots early in life.

8
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:36,620
What's so special about the flu?

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,790
Two factors make the flu a tough target.

10
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,210
First, there are more than 100 subtypes
of the influenza /ˌɪnflʊˈenzə/ virus,

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,309
and the ones in circulation 
change from season to season.

12
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,533
And second, the flu's genetic code
allows it to mutate /mju:teit 变异/ more quickly

13
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,820
than many other viruses.

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:00,910
The flu spreads by turning a host's own 
cells into viral production factories.

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,681
When the virus is engulfed /ɪnˈɡʌlf 吞噬/ by a host cell,
it expels /ɪkˈspɛl 驱逐/ its genetic material,

16
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:07,978
which makes its way to the nucleus /ˈnjuːklɪəs 细胞核/.

17
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,841
There, cellular /ˈsɛljʊlə 细胞的/ machinery /məˈʃiːnərɪ 机械/ that normally
copies the host's genes /dʒiːn/

18
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:14,882
starts replicating /ˈrɛplɪkɪt 复制(次品)  duplicate 镜像(地位等同)/ viral genes instead,

19
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:18,317
creating more and more copies
of the virus.

20
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:23,052
New viruses are repackaged 
and crammed /kræm 塞满/ into the cell until it bursts /bɜːst 爆裂/,

21
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:29,422
sending freshly /ˈfreʃlɪ 最近/ minted /mɪnt 全新的/ influenza viruses
out to infect additional cells.

22
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,892
Most viruses follow this script.

23
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,982
The trick /trɪk 诡计/ with the flu is that its genetic
material isn't DNA

24
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:39,303
but a similar compound called RNA.

25
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:44,193
And RNA viruses can mutate /mju:teit/ much faster.

26
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,094
When cells synthesize /ˈsɪnθɪˌsaɪz 合成/ DNA,

27
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:50,354
a built-in proofreader /ˈpruːfˌriːdə 校对员/ recognizes 
and corrects mistakes,

28
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:54,854
but the RNA synthesis /ˈsɪnθɪˌsaɪz 合成/ mechanism /ˈmɛkəˌnɪzəm 结构/
doesn't have this fail-safe.

29
00:01:54,854 --> 00:02:00,003
If errors creep /kriːp 蔓延/ in, they stick around
creating new variants /ˈvɛərɪənt 变种/ of the virus.

30
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,393
Why is this a problem?

31
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:04,623
Because vaccines /ˈvæksiːn/ depend on recognition.

32
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:09,364
The flu vaccine includes some of the same
substances /ˈsʌbstəns 物质/, called antigens /ˈæntɪdʒən 抗原/,

33
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,556
found on the surface of the virus itself.

34
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:15,654
The body identifies those fragments
as foreign

35
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:19,063
and responds by producing compounds
called antibodies,

36
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:22,094
tailor/ˈteɪlə 裁缝/-made to match the antigens /ˈæntɪdʒən 抗原/.

37
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:25,154
When a vaccinated /ˈvæksɪˌneɪt 接种疫苗/ person
encounters the actual /ˈæktʃʊəl 实际的/ virus,

38
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:29,614
the preprogrammed antibodies
help the immune system identify the threat

39
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:33,695
and mobilize /ˈməʊbɪˌlaɪz 动员/ quickly 
to prevent an infection.

40
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,886
Those antigens /ˈæntɪdʒən 抗原/ are different 
for every strain /streɪn 品种/ of influenza.

41
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:41,326
If vaccination has prepared 
the immune system for one strain /streɪn 品种/,

42
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:44,577
a different one may still 
be able to sneak /sniːk 偷偷地做/ by.

43
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:47,085
Even within the same strain of flu,

44
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:51,216
those rapid genetic mutations
can change the surface compounds enough

45
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:55,366
that the antibodies 
may not recognize them.

46
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,358
To make things even more complicated,

47
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:03,167
sometimes two different strains combine
to create an entirely new hybrid /ˈhaɪbrɪd 杂交/ virus.

48
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,286
All of this makes vaccinating for the flu

49
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,067
like trying to hit a moving 
transforming target.

50
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,887
That's why scientists are constantly
collecting data

51
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,108
about which strains are circulating

52
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:17,819
and checking to see how much those
strains have mutated

53
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,447
from previous years' versions.

54
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:24,398
Twice annually, the World 
Health Organization pulls together experts

55
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,387
to analyze all that data,

56
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:29,558
holding one meeting for each hemisphere.

57
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:33,788
The scientists determine which strains
to include in that season's vaccine,

58
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:38,090
picking four for the quadrivalent /ˌkwɒdrɪˈveɪlənt 四价的/ vaccine
in use today.

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,398
In spite of the flu's evasive /ɪˈveɪsɪv 逃避的/ maneuvers /məˈnuːvə 演习/,

60
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:45,808
in recent years, the group's predictions
have been almost always correct.

61
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:50,109
Even when flu strains mutate further,
the vaccine is often close enough

62
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:53,309
that a vaccinated person who catches
the flu anyway

63
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:58,139
will have a milder /maɪld 温和的/ and shorter illness
than they would otherwise.

64
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,560
Vaccination also helps protect
other people in the community

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,110
who may not be medically eligible /ˈɛlɪdʒəbəl 有资格的/
for the shot

66
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,512
by preventing those around them
from carrying the virus.

67
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,778
This is called herd /hɜːd 群体 放牧/ immunity.

68
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:12,050
The flu shot can't give you the flu.

69
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,199
It contains an inactivated virus
that isn't capable of making you sick.

70
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,000
You might feel tired 
and achy /ˈeɪkɪ 疼痛的/ after getting it,

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,710
but that's not an infection.

72
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,841
It's your normal immune response
to the vaccine.

73
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:27,861
Some parts of the world use, 
instead of a shot, an inhaled /ɪnˈheɪl 吸入/ vaccine

74
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:30,709
that contains a weakened live virus.

75
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,041
This is also safe for 
the vast majority of people.

76
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,512
Only those with impaired /ɪmˈpɛə 损害/ immune systems
would be at risk,

77
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,920
but they're typically 
not given live vaccines.

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,951
Meanwhile, scientists are working
to develop a universal /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːsəl/ flu vaccine

79
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,502
that would protect against any strain,
even mutated ones.

80
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:53,562
But until then, the hunt 
for next year's vaccine is on.
