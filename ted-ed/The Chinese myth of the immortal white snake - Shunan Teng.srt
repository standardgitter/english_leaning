1
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:11,479
The talented young herbalist named Xu Xian
was in trouble.

2
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,422
It should have been a victorious /vɪkˈtɔːriəs 胜利的/ moment–

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:16,212
he had just opened his very 
own medicine shop.

4
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:19,132
But he bought his supplies from 
his former employer,

5
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:22,252
and the resentful /rɪˈzɛntfʊl 怨恨的/ man 
sold him rotten /ˈrɒtən 腐烂de/ herbs.

6
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:25,722
As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this 
useless inventory /ˈɪnvəntərɪ 存货/,

7
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,892
patients flooded into his shop.

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,502
A plague /pleɪɡ 瘟疫/ had stricken /ˈstrɪkən 侵袭/ the city,

9
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,752
and he had nothing to treat them.

10
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:33,502
Just as he was starting to panic /ˈpænɪk 惊慌/,

11
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:39,242
his wife, Bai Su Zhen, produced a recipe /ˈrɛsɪpɪ 处方/
to use the rotten /ˈrɒtən 腐烂de/ herbs as medicine.

12
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:43,113
Her remedy /ˈrɛmɪdɪ 治疗/ cured all the plague-afflicted /əˈflɪkt 折磨/
citizens immediately.

13
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:46,503
Xu Xian’s former boss even had to buy back
some of the rotten herbs

14
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:48,193
to treat his own family.

15
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:52,793
Shortly after, a monk /mʌŋk/ named Fa Hai 
approached Xu Xian,

16
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,882
warning him that there was 
a demon /ˈdiːmən/ in his house.

17
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:58,502
The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen.

18
00:00:58,502 --> 00:00:59,932
Xu Xian laughed.

19
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:03,512
His kindhearted, resourceful /机智/ wife 
was not a demon.

20
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:04,922
Fa Hai insisted.

21
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:10,122
He told Xu Xian to serve his wife realgar /rɪˈælɡə 雄黄 /
wine /swine 猪/ on the 5th day of the 5th month,

22
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:12,052
when demons’ powers are weakest.

23
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:15,312
If she wasn’t a demon, he explained, 
it wouldn’t hurt her.

24
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:17,292
Xu Xian dismissed the monk politely /pəˈlaɪtlɪ/,

25
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,152
with no intention /ɪnˈtɛnʃən 意图/ of serving 
Bai Su Zhen the wine.

26
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:23,252
But as the day approached, 
he decided to try it.

27
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,902
As soon as the wine touched 
Bai Su Zhen’s lips,

28
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:29,122
she ran to the bedroom, 
claiming she wasn’t feeling well.

29
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,262
Xu Xian prepared some medicine 
and went to check on her.

30
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:33,712
But instead /ɪnˈstɛd/ of his wife,

31
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:37,952
he found a giant white serpent /ˈsɜːpənt  蛇/ with a
bloody forked tongue /tʌŋ  舌头/ in the bed.

32
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:40,512
He collapsed /kəˈlæps 衰竭/, killed by the shock /ʃɒk/.

33
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:42,482
When Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes,

34
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:45,292
she realized immediately what 
must have happened.

35
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:48,522
The truth was that Bai Su Zhen was 
an immortal /ɪˈmɔːtəl 不朽的/ snake

36
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,792
with formidable /fɔːˈmɪdəbəl 难对付的/ magical powers.

37
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,362
She had used her powers to take a 
human form

38
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:56,212
and improve her and 
her husband’s fortunes.

39
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:58,412
Her magic couldn’t revive /rɪˈvaɪv 复活/ Xu Xian,

40
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,822
but she had one more idea to save him:

41
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:05,052
an herb that could grant /grænt/ longevity /lɒnˈdʒɛvɪtɪ 长寿/
and even bring the dead back to life,

42
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,400
guarded /ˈɡɑːdɪd 被监督的/ by the Old Man of the South Pole /pəʊl/

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,250
in the forbidden peaks of the 
Kun Lun Mountains.

44
00:02:12,253 --> 00:02:15,543
She rode /ride过去/ to the mountains on a cloud,

45
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:18,303
then continued on foot passed gateways 
and arches /ɑːtʃ 拱门/

46
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,103
until she reached one 
marked “beyond mortals /ˈmɔːtəl 凡人/”

47
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,783
hanging over a silver bridge.

48
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,013
On the other side,

49
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:27,293
two of the Old Man’s disciples /dɪˈsaɪpəl 门徒/
guarded the herb.

50
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,753
Bai Su Zhen disguised /dɪsˈɡaɪz 伪装/ herself as a monk

51
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:33,883
and told them she’d come to invite 
the Old Man to a gathering of the gods.

52
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,377
While they relayed /ˈriːleɪ 传达/ her message,

53
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:37,575
she plucked /plʌk 采/ some leaves 
from the herb and ran.

54
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:40,595
The servants /ˈsɜːvənt 仆人/ realized they had been 
tricked and chased her.

55
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:43,715
Bai Su Zhen coughed /kɒf 咳嗽/ up a magic ball 
and threw it at one.

56
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,695
As the other closed in on her,

57
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,485
she put the herb under her tongue 
for safekeeping,

58
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:51,915
but its magic forced both of them 
into their true forms.

59
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:54,355
As the crane’/kreɪn 鹤/s long beak /biːk 鸟喙/ 
clamped / klæmp 夹紧/ around her,

60
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:55,985
the Old Man appeared.

61
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,125
Why, he asked, would she risk her life 
to steal his herb

62
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,995
when she was already immortal?

63
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,745
Bai Su Zhen explained 
her love for Xu Xian.

64
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:07,235
Even if he didn’t want to be with her 
now that he knew she was a demon,

65
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:09,725
she was determined to 
bring him back to life.

66
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:13,575
The two had a karmic /ˈkɑːmɪk 宿命/ connection dating 
back more than a thousand years.

67
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,625
When Bai Su Zhen was a small snake,

68
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,675
a beggar /ˈbɛɡə 乞丐/ was about to kill her,

69
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,965
but a kind passerby rescued her.

70
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,405
Her rescuer was Xu Xian in a past life.

71
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,885
Touched by her willingness 
to risk her life for him,

72
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:30,905
the Old Man permitted her to leave the 
mountain with the immortal herb.

73
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:35,831
Bai Su Zhen returned home 
to revive Xu Xian.

74
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,032
When he opened his eyes,

75
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:40,512
the terrified look frozen on his face 
became a smile.

76
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,411
Demon or not,

77
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:51,411
he was still happy to see his wife.
