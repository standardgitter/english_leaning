1
00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:11,171
"Sorry, my phone died."

2
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:13,471
"It's nothing. I'm fine."

3
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:16,723
"These allegations /æli'geiʃən 主张，陈述/
are completely unfounded /ʌnˈfaʊndɪd 无理由的/."

4
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:20,100
"The company was not aware
of any wrongdoing."

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,519
"I love you."

6
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:26,387
We hear anywhere
from 10 to 200 lies a day,

7
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:29,754
and we spent much of our history
coming up with ways to detect them,

8
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:32,676
from medieval /ˌmɛdɪˈiːvəl 中世纪的/ torture /ˈtɔːtʃə 拷问/
devices to polygraphs /ˈpɒlɪˌɡrɑːf 测谎器/,

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,018
blood-pressure and breathing monitors,
voice-stress analyzers,

10
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,701
eye trackers, infrared /ˌɪnfrəˈrɛd 红外线的/ brain scanners,

11
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:41,907
and even the 400-pound
electroencephalogram.

12
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:45,066
But although such tools have worked
under certain circumstances,

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,045
most can be fooled
with enough preparation,

14
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:52,097
and none are considered reliable enough
to even be admissible /ədˈmɪsəbəl 可容许的/ in court.

15
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,641
But, what if the problem
is not with the techniques,

16
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:59,042
but the underlying assumption
that lying spurs physiological /ˌfɪzɪəˈlɒdʒɪkəl 生理的/ changes?

17
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,047
What if we took a more direct approach,

18
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:04,239
using communication science
to analyze the lies themselves?

19
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:09,959
On a psychological level, we lie partly
to paint a better picture of ourselves,

20
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:12,835
connecting our fantasies /ˈfæntəsɪz 幻想/
to the person we wish we were

21
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,157
rather than the person we are.

22
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:19,545
But while our brain is busy dreaming,
it's letting plenty of signals slip by.

23
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:23,704
Our conscious /ˈkɒnʃəs 意识到/ mind only controls
about 5% of our cognitive /ˈkɒɡnɪtɪv 认知的，认识的/ function,

24
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,264
including communication,

25
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:28,664
while the other 95% occurs
beyond our awareness,

26
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,850
and according to the literature /ˈlɪtərɪtʃə 文献/
on reality monitoring,

27
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,212
stories based on imagined experiences

28
00:01:34,236 --> 00:01:38,093
are qualitatively /kwɔlitətivli/ different
from those based on real experiences.

29
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:42,119
This suggests that creating a false story
about a personal topic takes work

30
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,036
and results in a different
pattern of language use.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,207
A technology known
as linguistic /lɪŋˈɡwɪstɪk 语言学的/ text analysis

32
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,931
has helped to identify
four such common patterns

33
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:53,161
in the subconscious language of deception /dɪˈsɛpʃən 欺骗 诡计/.

34
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:58,473
First, liars reference themselves less,
when making deceptive statements.

35
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:02,224
They write or talk more about others,
often using the third person

36
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,216
to distance and disassociate
themselves from their lie,

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,134
which sounds more false:

38
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:09,966
"Absolutely no party took
place at this house,"

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,845
or "I didn't host a party here."

40
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:15,733
Second, liars tend to be more negative,

41
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:19,238
because on a subconscious level,
they feel guilty about lying.

42
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,398
For example, a liar
might say something like,

43
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:25,589
"Sorry, my stupid phone battery died.
I hate that thing."

44
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,853
Third, liars typically explain
events in simple terms

45
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,976
since our brains struggle
to build a complex lie.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,305
Judgment and evaluation

47
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:36,159
are complex things
for our brains to compute.

48
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:38,654
As a U.S. President once
famously insisted:

49
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:41,766
"I did not have sexual relations
with that woman."

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,659
And finally, even though liars
keep descriptions simple,

51
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:48,134
they tend to use longer
and more convoluted /ˈkɒnvəˌluːt/ˈkɒnvəˌluːtɪd  回旋，卷旋/费解的/ sentence structure,

52
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,740
inserting unnecessary words

53
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:53,476
and irrelevant /ɪˈrɛləvənt 不相关的/ but factual /ˈfæktʃʊəl/
sounding details in order to pad /pæd 填补/ the lie.

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,140
Another President confronted
with a scandal proclaimed /prəˈkleɪm 宣告/:

55
00:02:56,164 --> 00:02:59,510
"I can say, categorically /ˌkætɪˈɡɒrɪkəlɪ  绝对地/,
that this investigation indicates

56
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,297
that no one on the White House staff,

57
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:03,676
no one in this administration
presently employed

58
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,600
was involved
in this very bizarre /bɪˈzɑː 怪诞的/ incident."

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,164
Let's apply linguistic analysis
to some famous examples.

60
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:13,213
Take seven-time Tour de /də(籍贯）来自/ France
winner Lance Armstrong.

61
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,373
When comparing a 2005 interview,

62
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:18,250
in which he had denied taking
performance-enhancing drugs

63
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:21,188
to a 2013 interview,
in which he admitted it,

64
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:25,168
his use of personal pronouns
increased by nearly 3/4.

65
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,835
Note the contrast /ˈkɒntrɑːst 对比/
between the following two quotes.

66
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:32,146
First: "Okay, you know, a guy
in a French, in a Parisian laboratory

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,107
opens up your sample, you know,
Jean-Francis so-and-so, and he tests it.

68
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,828
And then you get a phone call
from a newspaper that says:

69
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,634
'We found you to be positive
six times for EPO."

70
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,004
Second: "I lost myself in all of that.

71
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:47,923
I'm sure there would be other people
that couldn't handle it,

72
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,704
but I certainly couldn't handle it,

73
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:52,726
and I was used to controlling
everything in my life.

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,388
I controlled every outcome in my life."

75
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:58,294
In his denial /dɪˈnaɪəl 否认/, Armstrong described
a hypothetical /ˌhaɪpəˈθɛtɪkəl 假设的/ situation

76
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:00,297
focused on someone else,

77
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,979
removing himself
from the situation entirely.

78
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,956
In his admission, he owns his statements,

79
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,585
delving  /dɛlv 翻找；挖掘/into his personal emotions
and motivations.

80
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,552
But the use of personal pronouns
is just one indicator of deception.

81
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:14,885
Let's look at another example
from former Senator /ˈsɛnətə 参议员/

82
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,137
and U.S. Presidential candidate
John Edwards:

83
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,740
"I only know that the apparent
father has said publicly

84
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,654
that he is the father of the baby.

85
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,690
I also have not been engaged
in any activity of any description

86
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:29,148
that requested, agreed to,
or supported payments of any kind

87
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:32,353
to the woman or to the apparent /əˈpærənt 表面上的/
father of the baby."

88
00:04:32,377 --> 00:04:36,396
Not only is that a pretty long-winded way
to say, "The baby isn't mine,"

89
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,306
but Edwards never calls
the other parties by name,

90
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,139
instead saying "that baby," "the woman,"
and "the apparent father."

91
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:46,192
Now let's see what he had to say
when later admitting paternity /pəˈtɜːnɪtɪ 父子关系/:

92
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:47,743
"I am Quinn's father.

93
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,024
I will do everything
in my power to provide her

94
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,141
with the love and support she deserves."

95
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,744
The statement is short and direct,

96
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,303
calling the child by name
and addressing his role in her life.

97
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:01,534
So how can you apply these
lie-spotting techniques to your life?

98
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:05,195
First, remember that many of the lies
we encounter on a daily basis /ˈbeɪsɪs/

99
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:09,820
are far less serious that these examples,
and may even be harmless.

100
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,504
But it's still worthwhile
to be aware of telltale /ˈtɛlˌteɪl 搬弄是非的；泄密的/ clues,

101
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:16,216
like minimal self-references,
negative language,

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,643
simple explanations
and convoluted /ˈkɒnvəˌluːt/ˈkɒnvəˌluːtɪd  回旋，卷旋/费解的/ phrasing.

103
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,819
It just might help you avoid
an overvalued stock,

104
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:27,843
an ineffective product,
or even a terrible relationship.
