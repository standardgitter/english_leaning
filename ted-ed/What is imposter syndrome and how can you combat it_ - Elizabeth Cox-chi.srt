1
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:13,152
What is imposter /ɪmˈpɒstə 冒名顶替者/ syndrome /ˈsɪndrəʊm 并发症/ and how can you combat it
Even after writing eleven books 
and winning several prestigious /preˈstɪdʒəs 享有声望的，声望很高的/ awards,

2
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,491
Maya Angelou couldn’t escape 
the nagging /næg 唠叨 不停地抱怨/ doubt

3
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:19,685
that she hadn’t really earned 
her accomplishments.

4
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,592
Albert Einstein /ˈaɪnstaɪn/ experienced 
something similar:

5
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:25,966
he described himself 
as an “involuntary /ɪnˈvɒləntərɪ 自然而然的,无意识的/ swindler /ˈswɪndlə 骗子/”

6
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,535
whose work didn’t deserve 
as much attention as it had received.

7
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:33,374
Accomplishments at the level 
of Angelou’s or Einstein’s are rare,

8
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:36,404
but their feeling of fraudulence /ˈfrɔːdjʊləns 欺诈/
is extremely common.

9
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,408
Why can’t so many of us shake feelings

10
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,594
that we haven’t earned 
our accomplishments,

11
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:45,019
or that our ideas and skills 
aren’t worthy of others’ attention?

12
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:48,401
Psychologist Pauline Rose Clance 
was the first to study

13
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,925
this unwarranted sense of insecurity.

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,294
In her work as a therapist,

15
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:56,646
she noticed many of her undergraduate 
patients shared a concern:

16
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:58,461
though they had high grades,

17
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:01,778
they didn’t believe they deserved 
their spots at the university.

18
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,021
Some even believed their acceptance 
had been an admissions error.

19
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,205
While Clance knew these fears 
were unfounded /ʌnˈfaʊndɪd 无根据的/,

20
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,766
she could also remember feeling
the exact /ɪɡˈzækt 精确的/ same way in graduate school.

21
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:14,470
She and her patients experienced
something that goes by a number of names--

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,118
imposter imposter /ɪmˈpɒstə 冒名顶替者/ phenomenon,

23
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,662
imposter experience,

24
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,865
and imposter syndrome /ˈsɪndrəʊm 并发症/.

25
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,634
Together with colleague /ˈkɒliːɡ/ Suzanne Imes,

26
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:26,616
Clance first studied imposterism
in female college students and faculty.

27
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:30,180
Their work established pervasive /pɜːˈveɪsɪv 弥漫的；渗透的 普遍的；/
feelings of fraudulence /ˈfrɔːdjʊləns 欺诈/ in this group.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,645
Since that first study,

29
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:34,380
the same thing has been established 
across gender,

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,134
race,

31
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,003
age,

32
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,370
and a huge range of occupations,

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,419
though it may be more prevalent /ˈprɛvələnt 流行的/
and disproportionately /ˌdɪsprəˈpɔːʃənɪtlɪ  不成比例地/ affect

34
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:44,759
the experiences of underrepresented /ˌʌndəˌreprɪˈzentɪd  未被充分代表的/
or disadvantaged groups.

35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,271
To call it a syndrome /ˈsɪndrəʊm 并发症/
is to downplay /ˈdaʊnˌpleɪ 对…轻描淡写；轻视/ how universal /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːsəl 广泛适用的/ it is.

36
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,276
It's not a disease or an abnormality /ˌæbnɔːˈmælɪtɪ 不正常/,

37
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:53,864
and it isn’t necessarily 
tied to depression,

38
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,825
anxiety,

39
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,536
or self-esteem /ɪˈstiːm 敬重/.

40
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:58,780
Where do these feelings 
of fraudulence come from?

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,194
People who are highly skilled 
or accomplished

42
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,189
tend to think others are just as skilled.

43
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,563
This can spiral /ˈspaɪərəl 螺旋/ into feelings 
that they don’t deserve accolades /ˈækəˌleɪd 嘉奖；荣誉/

44
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,596
and opportunities over other people.

45
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,186
And as Angelou and Einstein experienced,

46
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:13,508
there’s often no threshold /ˈθrɛʃəʊld 极限；临界值/
of accomplishment

47
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,531
that puts these feelings to rest.

48
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:20,357
Feelings of imposterism aren’t restricted 
to highly skilled individuals, either.

49
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:24,370
Everyone is susceptible /səˈsɛptɪbəl 易受影响的；易感动的/ to a phenomenon 
known as pluralistic /ˌplʊərəˈlɪstɪk 兼职的,多元论的/  ignorance /ˈɪɡnərəns 无知，愚昧/,

50
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,896
where we each doubt ourselves privately,

51
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:29,029
but believe we’re alone 
in thinking that way

52
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:31,244
because no one else voices their doubts.

53
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:34,973
Since it’s tough /tʌf 棘手的/ to really know 
how hard our peers /pɪə 凝视 同事 同辈/ work,

54
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:37,595
how difficult they find certain tasks,

55
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,516
or how much they doubt themselves,

56
00:02:39,516 --> 00:02:42,972
there’s no easy way to dismiss feelings 
that we’re less capable

57
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:44,727
than the people around us.

58
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,637
Intense feelings of imposterism

59
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:48,922
can prevent people 
from sharing their great ideas

60
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:52,656
or applying for jobs 
and programs where they’d excel /ɪkˈsɛl 胜过，优于；擅长/.

61
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:54,112
At least so far,

62
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,611
the most surefire /ʃuəfaiə 准不会有错的，确实的，可靠的/ way 
to combat imposter syndrome

63
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,153
is to talk about it.

64
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,226
Many people suffering 
from imposter syndrome

65
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:02,557
are afraid that if they ask 
about their performance,

66
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,128
their fears will be confirmed.

67
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:06,273
And even when 
they receive positive feedback,

68
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:09,317
it often fails /feɪl/ to ease 
feelings of fraudulence.

69
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:10,347
But on the other hand,

70
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:14,425
hearing that an advisor or mentor /ˈmɛntɔː 指导者，导师 指导/ has
experienced feelings of imposterism

71
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,116
can help relieve those feelings.

72
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:18,193
The same goes for peers.

73
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:20,717
Even simply finding out there’s a term /项/
for these feelings

74
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,700
can be an incredible relief.

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,191
Once you’re aware of the phenomenon,

76
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,616
you can combat /ˈkɒmbæt/ your own imposter syndrome 

77
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:29,387
by collecting 
and revisiting positive feedback.

78
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:32,380
One scientist who kept blaming herself 
for problems in her lab

79
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,557
started to document the causes 
every time something went wrong.

80
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:38,160
Eventually, she realized most 
of the problems

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,902
came from equipment failure,

82
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:42,150
and came to recognize her own competence /ˈkɒmpɪtəns 能力；权限/.

83
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,201
We may never be able 
to banish /ˈbænɪʃ 驱逐；消除/ these feelings entirely,

84
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:49,553
but we can have open conversations 
about academic /ækə'demɪk/ or professional challenges.

85
00:03:49,553 --> 00:03:53,330
With increasing awareness 
of how common /ˈkɒmən/ these experiences are,

86
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,808
perhaps we can feel freer to be frank  /fræŋk 直率的/
about our feelings

87
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,839
and build confidence 
in some simple truths:

88
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,048
you have talent,

89
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,408
you are capable,

90
00:04:01,408 --> 00:00:00,000
and you belong /适宜/.
