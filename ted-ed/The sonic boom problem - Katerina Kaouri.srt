1
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:10,513
Humans have been fascinated /ˈfæsɪˌneɪt 使着迷/
with speed for ages.

2
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:14,746
The history of human progress
is one of ever-increasing velocity,

3
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:18,611
and one of the most important achievements
in this historical race

4
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:21,503
was the breaking of the sound barrier /ˈbærɪə/.

5
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,871
Not long after the first
successful airplane flights,

6
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:29,983
pilots were eager to push
their planes to go faster and faster.

7
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,384
But as they did so, increased turbulence /ˈtɜːbjʊləns 动荡；狂暴；湍流/

8
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:37,688
and large forces on the plane
prevented them from accelerating further.

9
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:41,647
Some tried to circumvent /ˌsɜːkəmˈvɛnt 避免；绕行/
the problem through risky dives,

10
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:44,085
often with tragic results.

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,550
Finally, in 1947, design improvements,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,302
such as a movable horizontal stabilizer /ˈsteɪbɪˌlaɪzə 水平尾翼/,
the all-moving tail,

13
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,521
allowed an American military pilot
named Chuck Yeager

14
00:00:55,521 --> 00:01:03,721
to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h,

15
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,924
becoming the first person
to break the sound barrier

16
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:09,720
and travel faster than the speed of sound.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,929
The Bell X-1 was the first of many
supersonic aircraft to follow,

18
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:17,913
with later designs reaching
speeds over Mach 3.

19
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:21,573
Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed
create a shock wave

20
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:25,682
with a thunder-like noise
known as a sonic boom,

21
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:29,179
which can cause distress /dɪˈstrɛs 忧虑，悲伤 困苦；遇难/ to people
and animals below

22
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,070
or even damage buildings.

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,070
For this reason,

24
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:35,345
scientists around the world
have been looking at sonic booms,

25
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,788
trying to predict their path
in the atmosphere,

26
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:42,191
where they will land,
and how loud they will be.

27
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,310
To better understand
how scientists study sonic booms,

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,298
let's start with some basics of sound.

29
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:51,931
Imagine throwing a small stone
in a still /stɪl 寂静的/ pond.

30
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,177
What do you see?

31
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:55,875
The stone causes waves
to travel in the water

32
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,670
at the same speed in every direction.

33
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,887
These circles that keep growing in radius /ˈreɪdɪəs 半径/
are called wave fronts.

34
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:05,904
Similarly, even though we cannot see it,

35
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:09,306
a stationary /ˈsteɪʃənərɪ 固定的；静止的/ sound source,
like a home stereo /ˈstɛrɪəʊ/,

36
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:12,199
creates sound waves traveling outward.

37
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,330
The speed of the waves depends on factors

38
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,110
like the altitude /ˈæltɪˌtjuːd 海拔/ and temperature /ˈtɛmprɪtʃə/
of the air they move through.

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,463
At sea level, sound travels
at about 1225 km/h.

40
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:27,290
But instead of circles
on a two-dimensional /daɪˈmɛnʃənəl 空间的，维的/ surface,

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,732
the wave fronts
are now concentric / kənˈsɛntrɪk 同轴的，同中心的/ spheres,

42
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:35,901
with the sound traveling along rays /reɪ 射线/
perpendicular /ˌpɜːpənˈdɪkjʊlə 垂直的，直立的/ to these waves.

43
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:40,076
Now imagine a moving sound source,
such as a train whistle.

44
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,034
As the source keeps moving
in a certain direction,

45
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:47,566
the successive /səkˈsɛsɪv 连续的/ waves in front of it
will become bunched closer together.

46
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:52,636
This greater wave frequency is the cause
of the famous Doppler /dɔplə/ effect,

47
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:55,729
where approaching objects
sound higher pitched /pɪtʃ 音高 投掷/.

48
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,927
But as long as the source is moving
slower than the sound waves themselves,

49
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:02,756
they will remain nested /ˈnestɪd 嵌套的/ within each other.

50
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:07,771
It's when an object goes supersonic,
moving faster than the sound it makes,

51
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,597
that the picture changes dramatically.

52
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:13,200
As it overtakes  /赶上/ sound waves
it has emitted,

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,702
while generating new ones from
its current position,

54
00:03:15,702 --> 00:03:19,820
the waves are forced together,
forming a Mach cone /kəʊn 圆锥体/.

55
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,808
No sound is heard
as it approaches an observer

56
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:27,888
because the object is traveling faster
than the sound it produces.

57
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:33,051
Only after the object has passed
will the observer hear the sonic boom.

58
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:37,007
Where the Mach cone /kəʊn 圆锥体/ meets the ground,
it forms a hyperbola /haɪˈpɜːbələ 双曲线/,

59
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:41,306
leaving a trail /treɪl 踪迹/ known as the boom carpet /ˈkɑːpɪt 地毯/
as it travels forward.

60
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:46,253
This makes it possible to determine
the area affected by a sonic boom.

61
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:49,303
What about figuring out how strong
a sonic boom will be?

62
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:52,869
This involves solving the famous
Navier-Stokes equations /ɪˈkweɪʒən 方程式/

63
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:56,265
to find the variation /vɛərɪˈeɪʃən 变化；变异，变种/
of pressure in the air

64
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:59,516
due to the supersonic aircraft
flying through it.

65
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:03,853
This results in the pressure signature
known as the N-wave.

66
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:05,483
What does this shape mean?

67
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:09,506
Well, the sonic boom occurs
when there is a sudden change in pressure,

68
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,918
and the N-wave involves two booms:

69
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,497
one for the initial pressure rise
at the aircraft's nose,

70
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:18,349
and another for when the tail passes,

71
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,017
and the pressure suddenly
returns to normal.

72
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,130
This causes a double boom,

73
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,636
but it is usually heard as a single boom
by human ears.

74
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,878
In practice, computer models
using these principles

75
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:34,023
can often predict the location
and intensity /ɪnˈtɛnsɪtɪ 剧烈；紧张 强度/ of sonic booms

76
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,626
for given atmospheric conditions
and flight trajectories /trəˈdʒɛktərɪ 弹道 轨道；轨迹/,

77
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:40,738
and there is ongoing research
to mitigate /ˈmɪtɪˌɡeɪt 使减轻，缓和/ their effects.

78
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:45,809
In the meantime, supersonic flight
over land remains prohibited.

79
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,572
So, are sonic booms a recent creation?

80
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:50,088
Not exactly.

81
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,516
While we try to find ways to silence them,

82
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:56,045
a few other animals have been
using sonic booms to their advantage.

83
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,954
The gigantic /dʒaɪˈɡæntɪk 巨大的/ Diplodocus may have been
capable of cracking /kræk（使）爆裂；打破/ its tail

84
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:07,937
faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h,
possibly to deter /dɪˈtɜː 阻止，使不敢，使打消念头/ predators /ˈprɛdətə/.

85
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:12,437
Some types of shrimp can also create
a similar shock wave underwater,

86
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,163
stunning /stʌn 晕眩，猛击/ or even killing pray /preɪ 猎物；掠食/
at a distance

87
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:19,733
with just a snap /snæp   猛咬，折断/ of their oversized claw /klɔː  爪；螯，钳/.

88
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,203
So while we humans
have made great progress

89
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:24,853
in our relentless /rɪˈlɛntlɪs 无情的 不间断的 / pursuit of speed,

90
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:29,853
it turns out that nature was there first.
