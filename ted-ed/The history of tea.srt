1
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:11,090
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs,

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,839
the weary /ˈwɪərɪ 疲倦的/ divine /dɪˈvaɪn 神的/ farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times.

3
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,139
But before the poisons could end his life,

4
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,620
a leaf drifted /drɪft 漂/ into his mouth.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,130
He chewed /tʃuː/ on it and it revived /rɪˈvaɪv 复活/ him,

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,701
and that is how we discovered tea.

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,562
Or so an ancient /ˈeɪnʃənt/ legend /ˈlɛdʒənd/ goes at least.

8
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,461
Tea doesn't actually cure /kjʊə 治疗/ poisonings,

9
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,082
but the story of Shennong,

10
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:35,540
the mythical /ˈmɪθɪkəl 神话的/ Chinese inventor 
of agriculture,

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,682
highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China.

12
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:41,811
Archaeological /ˌɑːkɪəˈlɒdʒɪkəl 考古学的/ evidence /ˈɛvɪdəns/ suggests tea
was first cultivated there

13
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:44,271
as early as 6,000 years ago,

14
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:48,535
or 1,500 years before the pharaohs /ˈfeərəʊ 法老/ built
the Great Pyramids /ˈpɪrəmɪd/ of Giza.

15
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:50,080
That original Chinese tea plant

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,952
is the same type that's grown 
around the world today,

17
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,631
yet it was originally consumed
very differently.

18
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:59,291
It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge /ˈpɒrɪdʒ 粥/.

19
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,751
Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago

20
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:06,252
when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture /ˈmɔɪstʃə 潮气/

21
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:10,992
could create a complex and varied /ˈvɛərɪ 改变/ taste
out of the leafy green.

22
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:14,032
After hundreds of years of variations /ˌvɛərɪˈeɪʃən 改变/
to the preparation method,

23
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,101
the standard became to heat tea,

24
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,992
pack it into portable cakes,

25
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:19,706
grind /ɡraɪnd 磨，碾/ it into powder,

26
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:21,203
mix with hot water,

27
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:25,634
and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha.

28
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:30,141
Matcha became so popular that a distinct /dɪˈstɪŋkt/
Chinese tea culture emerged /ɪˈmɜːdʒ/.

29
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:32,192
Tea was the subject of books and poetry /ˈpəʊɪtrɪ 诗歌/,

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,983
the favorite drink of emperors /ˈempərə 皇帝/,

31
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,853
and a medium /ˈmiːdɪəm 媒介/ for artists.

32
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:38,703
They would draw extravagant /ɪkˈstrævəɡənt 奢侈的/ pictures
in the foam of the tea,

33
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:42,932
very much like the espresso /eˈspresəʊ 浓咖啡/ art
you might see in coffee shops today.

34
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,373
In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty /ˈdaɪnəsti/,

35
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:49,354
a Japanese monk /mʌŋk 和尚/ brought the first
tea plant to Japan.

36
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:53,243
The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals /ˈrɪtjʊəl 习惯的/ around tea,

37
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,394
leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony /ˈsɛrəmənɪ 典礼/.

38
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:59,034
And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty /ˈdaɪnəsti/,

39
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:01,284
the Chinese emperor /ˈempərə/
shifted the standard

40
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:04,845
from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea.

41
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:08,753
At that point, China still held a
virtual /ˈvɜːtʃʊəl 实质上的/ monopoly /məˈnɒpəlɪ  垄断/ on the world's tea trees,

42
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,416
making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods,

43
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,855
along with porcelain /ˈpɔːslɪn 瓷器/ and silk.

44
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:17,806
This gave China a great deal of power
and economic /i英 e美/ influence /ˈɪnflʊəns/

45
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:20,585
as tea drinking spread around the world.

46
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:23,623
That spread began /bɪˈɡæn/ in earnest /ˈɜːnɪst 认真的/
around the early 1600s

47
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:27,195
when Dutch /dʌtʃ 荷兰人/ traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities /ˈkwɒntɪtɪ 大量/.

48
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:30,725
Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese /ˌpɔːtjʊˈɡiːz/ noble /ˈnəʊbəl  贵族/ woman,

49
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,785
for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy /ˌærɪˈstɒkrəsɪ 贵族（阶层），上层社会 /

50
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:37,915
when she married King Charles II in 1661.

51
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:41,834
At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst /mɪdst 在…中间/ of expanding its colonial /kəˈləʊnɪəl 殖民的/ influence

52
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,766
and becoming the new dominant /ˈdɒmɪnənt 支配的/ world power.

53
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:48,586
And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world.

54
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:53,195
By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee

55
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:56,287
and the plant was still 
only grown in China.

56
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,844
The tea trade was so lucrative /ˈluːkrətɪv 赚大钱的/

57
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,531
that the world's fastest sailboat /seilbəut 帆船/, 
the clipper /ˈklɪpə 快速帆船/ship,

58
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:04,926
was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies.

59
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,495
All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first

60
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:09,776
to maximize /ˈmæksɪˌmaɪz/ their profits.

61
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:13,656
At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver /ˈsɪlvə/.

62
00:03:13,656 --> 00:03:15,220
When that proved /pruːvd/ too expensive,

63
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,689
they suggested trading tea 
for another substance /ˈsʌbstəns 物质/, opium /ˈəʊpɪəm 鸦片/.

64
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,108
This triggered a public health problem
within China

65
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:24,796
as people became addicted /əˈdɪktɪd 上瘾的/ to the drug.

66
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:28,038
Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men

67
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:30,547
to destroy massive  /ˈmæsɪv/
British shipments of opium /ˈəʊpɪəm 鸦片/

68
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,927
as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China.

69
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:37,598
This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations.

70
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,488
Fighting raged /reɪdʒ 愤怒/ up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842

71
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:45,437
when the defeated /dɪˈfiːt/ Qing Dynasty ceded /siːd 割让/
the port of Hong Kong to the British

72
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:48,131
and resumed /rɪˈzjuːm 摘要/ trading on unfavorable terms.

73
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,077
The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century.

74
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:56,818
The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves

75
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:58,948
and further control the market.

76
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,391
So they commissioned /kəˈmɪʃən 委托/
botanist /ˈbɒtənɪst 植物学家/ Robert Fortune

77
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:05,108
to steal tea from China 
in a covert /ˈkʌvət 隐蔽的/ operation.

78
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,479
He disguised /dɪsˈɡaɪzd 伪装/ himself 
and took a perilous /ˈpɛrɪləs 危险的/ journey

79
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,458
through China's mountainous tea regions,

80
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,428
eventually smuggling /ˈsmʌɡəl 走私/ tea trees 
and experienced tea workers

81
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:14,858
into Darjeeling, India.

82
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,039
From there, 
the plant spread further still,

83
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,389
helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity /kəˈmɒdɪtɪ 商品/.

84
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,699
Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water,

85
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,449
and from sugary Turkish Rize tea,

86
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,440
to salty Tibetan butter tea,

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,041
there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage

88
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,041
as there are cultures on the globe.
