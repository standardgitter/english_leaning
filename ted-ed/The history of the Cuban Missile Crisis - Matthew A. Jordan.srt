1
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:10,363
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment,

2
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:14,503
you and everyone you know could be
wiped /waɪp/ out without warning

3
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:17,253
at the push of a button.

4
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:21,115
This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period

5
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:22,843
after World War II,

6
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:25,325
now known as the Cold War.

7
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,974
As the United States and Soviet /ˈsəʊvɪət/ Union
faced off across the globe,

8
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:33,874
each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable /ˈkeɪpəbəl/ of destroying it.

9
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:37,486
And destruction never loomed /luːm 朦胧/ closer
than during the 13 days

10
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:40,215
of the Cuban /ˈkjuːbən/ Missile Crisis.

11
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:46,586
In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow /ˌəʊvəˈθrəʊ 推翻/ Cuba's /ˈkjuːbə/ new communist /ˈkɒmjʊnɪst/ government.

12
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,704
That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs,

13
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:53,495
and it convinced /kənˈvɪnst 确信/ Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R.

14
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:57,067
Soviet premier /ˈprɛmjə 总理/ Nikita Khrushchev /kruːsˈtʃɒf/
was happy to comply /kəmˈplaɪ 服从/

15
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,465
by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba,

16
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,004
not only to protect the island,

17
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:07,485
but to counteract /ˌkaʊntərˈækt 抵消/ the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy /ˈɪtəlɪ/ and Turkey.

18
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,165
By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan,

19
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:14,086
the materials to create the missiles
were already in place.

20
00:01:14,086 --> 00:01:17,985
At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962,

21
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,405
military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites

22
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,036
and invasion /ɪnˈveɪʒən/ of the island.

23
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:27,495
But President John F. Kennedy /ˈkenɪdɪ/ chose
a more careful approach.

24
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,546
On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy

25
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:33,995
would intercept all shipments to Cuba.

26
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:35,427
There was just one problem:

27
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:39,436
a naval blockade /blɒˈkeɪd （尤指对港口的）封锁/ was considered
an act of war.

28
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,986
Although the President called it
a quarantine /ˈkwɒrənˌtiːn 检疫，隔离/

29
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:44,027
that did not block basic necessities /nəˈsesɪtɪz/,

30
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:47,577
the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction /dɪˈstɪŋkʃən 差异/.

31
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:49,398
In an outraged /ˈaʊtˌreɪdʒ 愤怒/ letter to Kennedy,

32
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:53,297
Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters

33
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:56,677
and international airspace
is an act of aggression /əˈɡreʃən 侵犯 /

34
00:01:56,677 --> 00:02:02,637
which pushes mankind toward the abyss /əˈbɪs 深渊/
of world nuclear missile war."

35
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:07,217
Thus ensued /ɪnˈsjuː 接着发生/ the most intense
six days of the Cold War.

36
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:09,645
While the U.S. demanded the removal /rɪˈmuːvəl/
of the missiles,

37
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:13,627
Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive.

38
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:16,758
And as the weapons continued
to be armed,

39
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:20,178
the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion.

40
00:02:20,178 --> 00:02:24,438
On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:27,299
was shot down by a Soviet missile.

42
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,427
The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine /ˈsʌbməˌriːn/ was hit by a small-depth charge

43
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:36,978
from a U.S. Navy vessel /ˈvɛsəl 船 血管 / trying
to signal /ˈsɪɡnəl/ it to come up.

44
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:40,308
The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface /ˈsɜːfɪs/,

45
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:45,759
thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo /tɔːˈpiːdəʊ/.

46
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,698
That decision had to be made unanimously /juːˈnænɪməslɪ/
by three officers.

47
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:53,578
The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch,

48
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:58,069
but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused.

49
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,771
His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world.

50
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,950
But the crisis wasn't over.

51
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,610
For the first time in history,

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,903
the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2,

53
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:12,839
the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war.

54
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,230
With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch,

55
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,199
the metaphorical /ˌmetəˈfɒrɪkəl 隐喻的/ Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight.

56
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,278
But diplomacy /dɪˈpləʊməsɪ/ carried on.

57
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:25,363
In Washington /ˈwɒʃɪŋtən/, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy

58
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:29,859
secretly met with Soviet Ambassador /æmˈbæsədə/
Anatoly Dobrynin.

59
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:33,720
After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,839
The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy

61
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,900
and promise to never invade Cuba

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,649
in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection.

63
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,637
Once the meeting had concluded,

64
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,982
Dobrynin cabled /ˈkeɪbəl （给...）发电报/ Moscow /ˈmɒskəʊ/ saying 
time is of the essence /ˈɛsəns 本质/

65
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:51,450
and we shouldn't miss the chance.

66
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,139
And at 9 a.m. the next day,

67
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,870
a message arrived from Khrushchev

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,851
announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba.

69
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:01,240
The crisis was now over.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,107
While criticized /ˈkrɪtɪˌsaɪz/ at the time by their
respective /rɪˈspɛktɪv 各自的/ governments

71
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,121
for bargaining with the enemy,

72
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,429
contemporary /kənˈtɛmprərɪ 同代人/ historical /hɪˈstɒrɪkəl/ analysis
shows great admiration /ˌædməˈreɪʃən 赞美/

73
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:14,051
for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically /ˌdɪpləˈmætɪkəlɪ/ solve the crisis.

74
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:17,250
But the disturbing /dɪˈstɜːb 打扰/ lesson was that
a slight communication error,

75
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,900
or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted /θwɔːt 阻挠，挫败/ all their efforts,

76
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:27,360
as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous /kəˈreɪdʒəs/ choice.

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,311
The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile /ˈfrædʒaɪl/ human politics are

78
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:41,311
compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash /ʌnˈliːʃ 解除...的束缚/.
