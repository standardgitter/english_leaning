A glimpse /ɡlɪmps 一瞥 /of teenage life in ancient Rome

2
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,094
It's March the 17th in A.D. 73.

3
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,288
We're visiting ancient Rome /rəʊm/
to watch the Liberalia,

4
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:28,956
an annual festival /ˈfɛstɪvəl/ that celebrates
the liberty of Rome's citizens.

5
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:36,251
We're looking in at a 17-year-old
named Lucius Popidius Secundus.

6
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:41,111
He's not from a poor family, but he lives
in the region known as the Subura,

7
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:45,550
a poorer neighborhood in Rome,
yet close to the center of the city.

8
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,574
(Gong)

9
00:00:48,084 --> 00:00:50,525
The tenants /ˈtenənt/ of these
apartments are crammed /kræm 塞满/ in,

10
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:51,550
(Grunting /ɡrʌnt 呼噜声/)

11
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,629
which poses /pəʊz 造成/ considerable risk.

12
00:00:54,851 --> 00:01:00,225
Fires are frequent and the smell of ash /æʃ 灰烬/
and smoke in the morning is not uncommon.

13
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:06,274
Lucius, who awoke at dawn,
has family duties to perform today.

14
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:08,785
(Cheering)

15
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,367
His 15-year-old brother is coming of age.

16
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:16,812
Half the children in ancient Rome
die before they reach adulthood /əˈdʌlthʊd/,

17
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:20,106
so this is a particularly
important milestone.

18
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,970
Lucius watches his brother
stand in his new toga /ˈtəʊɡə 托加长袍/

19
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:27,459
before the household shrine /ʃraɪn 神龛/
with its protective deities /ˈdeɪtɪ 女神/,

20
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:31,440
as he places his bulla /bʊlə 垂饰/,
a protective amulet /ˈæmjʊlət 护身符/,

21
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,790
in the shrine /ʃraɪn 神龛/ with a prayer of thanks.

22
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:38,237
The bulla /bʊlə 垂饰/ had worked.
It had protected him.

23
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,256
Unlike many others,
he had survived to become an adult.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,778
At 17, Lucius has almost
completed his education.

25
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:53,035
He has learned to speak well,
make public speeches,

26
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:56,159
and how to read and write
both Latin /ˈlætɪn/ and Greek.

27
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:59,873
His father has taught him
the types of things

28
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:02,389
you can't learn in the classroom:

29
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,142
how to run,

30
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,832
how to swim,

31
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,270
and how to fight.

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:13,394
Lucius could choose, at 17,
to become a military tribune /ˈtrɪbjuːn 护民官/

33
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:15,772
and command soldiers
on the edge of the Empire.

34
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,008
But in other ways,
Lucius is still a child.

35
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:24,871
He's not trusted
to arrange business deals.

36
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,386
His father will take care
of that until he is 25.

37
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:35,430
And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage
to a girl 10 years younger.

38
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:41,026
His dad has his eye on a family
with a 7-year-old daughter.

39
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,229
Back to the Liberalia.

40
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,409
As Lucius leaves with his family,

41
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,058
the shops are open as the population
goes about its business.

42
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:54,511
The streets are full
of itinerant /aɪˈtɪnərənt 流动性的/ traders selling trinkets /trɪŋkɪt 小饰品/

43
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,902
and people bustling /ˈbʌsəl 喧闹/ from place to place.

44
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:02,254
Large wagons /ˈwæɡən/ are not allowed
in the city until after the ninth hour

45
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,235
but the streets are still crowded.

46
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:10,328
Fathers and uncles
take the kids to the Forum /ˈfɔːrəm/ Augustus /ɔ:'gʌstəs/

47
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:13,157
to see statues of Rome's famous warriors

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,243
like Aeneas /i'ni:əs/, who led Rome's ancestors /ˈænsestər 祖先/,
the Trojans /trodʒənz/, to Italy.

49
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,932
And Romulus /rɑmjələs/, Rome's founder /创立者/.

50
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:25,677
And all the great generals of the Republic
from more than 100 years earlier.

51
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,861
Lovingly, we can imagine
fathers and guardians /gɑrdɪən 监护人/

52
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:33,444
with their now adult children

53
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:36,664
remembering stories of Rome's glory /ˈɡlɔːri/

54
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:40,578
and re-telling the good deeds /diːd 功绩/ and sayings
of the great men of the past:

55
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,688
lessons on how to live well,

56
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:46,560
and to overcome /ˌəʊvəˈkʌm 克服/ the follies /ˈfɒlɪ 愚蠢/ of youth / juːθ/.

57
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:51,835
There is a sense of history in this place,
relevant to their present.

58
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:57,806
Romans made an empire
without end in time and space.

59
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,831
(Thump /θʌmp 重击声/)

60
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,518
Rome was destined /ˈdestɪn 命注定/ to be
eternal /ɪˈtɜːnl/ through warfare.

61
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,879
Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73.

62
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:10,994
There are campaigns /kæmˈpeɪn/ in the north
of England and into Scotland,

63
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,678
to the north of the River
Danube /'dænju:b 多瑙河/ into Romania,

64
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:18,583
and on the frontier
between Syria /ˈsɪriə/ and Iraq /ɪˈrɑːk/ to the east.

65
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,249
It's now the eighth hour --
time to head for the baths /bɑːθ/.

66
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:26,461
Lucius and his family head up
the Via Lata, the wide street,

67
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:30,396
to the Campus Martius,
and the enormous /ɪˈnɔːməs  庞大的/ Baths of Agrippa /ə'gripə/.

68
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:35,403
The family members leave
the clients and freedmen /被解放的奴隶/ outside,

69
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,761
and enter the baths with their peer group.

70
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,109
Baths would change from dark,
steamy /ˈstiːmi 蒸汽的/ rooms to light ones.

71
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,212
The Romans had perfected /ˈpɜːfɪkt/ window glass.

72
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:51,311
Everyone moves from the cold room

73
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,548
to the tepid /ˈtepɪd 微温的/ room

74
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,942
and to the very hot room.

75
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,149
(Man) Oops!

76
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:00,577
More than an hour later, the bathers leave

77
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,807
massaged /məˈsɑːʒ/, oiled,

78
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,973
(Whistling)

79
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,731
and have been scraped /skræp 拆毁/ down with a strigil /strɪdʒɪl 刮肤器 /

80
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,321
to remove the remaining dirt.

81
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:14,126
At the ninth hour, seven hours
after they left home,

82
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,648
the men return for a celebratory /ˌseləˈbreɪtəri/ dinner.

83
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,278
Dinner is an intimate /ˈɪntɪmɪt 亲密的/ affair,

84
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:24,072
with nine people
reclining  /rɪˈklaɪn 使斜靠/ around the low table.

85
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,428
Slaves attend to their every need

86
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:32,075
if the diners, through gestures /ˈdʒɛstʃə 手势/,
demand more food and wine.

87
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:38,223
As the day closes, we can hear
the rumble /ˈrʌmbl 隆隆声/ of wagons /ˈwæɡən/ outside.

88
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,646
The clients and freedmen,

89
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,796
with a meal of robust /ˈwæɡən/
-- if inferior /ɪnˈfɪərɪə 低等的 部下/ -- food inside them,

90
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,028
shuffle /ˈʃʌfəl 拖着脚步走/ off to the now tepid /ˈtepɪd 微温的/ baths

91
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:48,240
before returning
to their apartment blocks.

92
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:54,345
Back at Lucius' house,
the drinking continues into the night.

93
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:57,346
Lucius and his stepbrother /ˈstepbrʌðə 异父之兄弟/
don't look too well.

94
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,866
A slave stands by in case
either of them needs to vomit /ˈvɒmɪt 呕吐/.

95
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:07,910
With hindsight /ˈhaɪndˌsaɪt 事后聪明/, we know Lucius' future.

96
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:13,345
In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's /ves'peiʒiən/
youngest son, Domitian /'də'miʃən/, as emperor,

97
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,997
will enact /ɪˈnækt 颁布/ a reign /reɪn 支配/ of terror. / terə 恐怖/

98
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,237
Will Lucius survive?

99
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:22,261
(Drums /drʌm 鼓 鼓声/)
