(music)

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:38,976
How pandemics /pænˈdemɪk 瘟疫/ spread

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,976
We live in an interconnected,
an increasingly globalized world.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,976
Thanks to international jet travel,

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,976
people and the diseases they carry

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,976
can be in any city on the planet
in a matter of hours.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,976
And once a virus touches down,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,976
sometimes all it takes
is one sneeze /sniːz 打喷嚏/ to spread

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,976
the infection throughout the community.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,976
When humans were hunter-gatherers,
roaming the wild savannas /səˈvænə 大草原/,

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,976
we were never in one place long enough,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,976
and settlements were not large enough

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,976
to sustain /səˈsteɪn 支撑/ the transmission
of infectious /ɪnˈfɛkʃəs 传染的/ microbes /ˈmaɪkrəʊb 微生物/.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,976
But with the advent /ˈædvent 降临/
of the agricultural revolution

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,976
10,000 years ago, and the arrival
of permanent settlements

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,143
in the Middle East, people began
living side-by-side with animals,

17
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,976
facilitating /fəˈsɪlɪˌteɪt 使便利/ the spread
of bacteria and viruses

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,976
between cattle /ˈkætəl 牛 家畜 / and humans.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,976
Epidemics /ˌɛpɪˈdɛmɪk  流行病/ and pandemics /pænˈdemɪk 瘟疫/ come
in many shapes and forms.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,976
In 2010, for instance,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,976
a devastating /ˈdɛvəˌsteɪt 摧毁/ earthquake struck Haiti /ˈheɪtɪ/,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,976
forcing thousands of people
into temporary refugee camps.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,976
Within weeks, the camps had become
breeding grounds for cholera /ˈkɒlərə 霍乱/,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,976
a bacteria spread by contaminated /kən'tæmineit 污染/ water,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,976
triggering a country-wide epidemic /ˌɛpɪˈdɛmɪk  流行病/. 

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,976
But the most common cause
of epidemics are viruses,

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,976
such as measles /ˈmiːzəlz 麻疹/, influenza /ˌɪnflʊˈenzə 流感/ and HIV.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,976
And when they go global,
we call them pandemics.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,976
Pandemics have occurred
throughout human history,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,976
Some have left scars on the tissue
and bone of their victims,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,976
while evidence for others
comes from preserved /prɪˈzɜ:vd 保存/ DNA.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,976
For instance, scientists
have recovered DNA

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,976
from the bacteria
that transmits tuberculosis /tjʊˌbɜːkjʊˈləʊsɪs  肺结核/

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,976
from the remains of ancient
Egyptian mummies /ˈmʌmɪ 木乃伊/.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,976
And in 2011,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,976
scientists investigating a plague /pleɪɡ 瘟疫/
pit /pɪt 坑/ in the city of London

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,976
were able to reconstruct
the genome /dʒi:nəum 基因组/ of Yersinia pestis /鼠疫/,

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,976
the bacterium /bækˈtɪərɪəm 细菌/ responsible for the Black
Death of the 14th century.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,976
It is thought the plague /pleɪɡ 瘟疫/
originated /əˈrɪdʒɪˌneɪt 起源于/ in China

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,976
in around 1340,

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,976
spreading west along the Silk Road,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,976
the caravan /ˈkærəˌvæn 旅行队/ route running
from Mongolia /mɒŋˈɡəʊlɪə/ to the Crimea /kraɪˈmɪə 克里米亚/.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,976
In 1347, the plague reached
the Mediterranean /ˌmɛdɪtəˈreɪnɪən/,

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,976
and by 1400, it had killed in excess /ˈɛksɛs 过量/ of

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,976
34 million Europeans,
earning it the title,

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,976
the Great Mortality /mɔːˈtælɪtɪ 必死性/.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,976
It was later historians /hɪˈstɔːrɪən 历史学家/
who called it the Black Death.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,976
However, by far the greatest
pandemic killer

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,976
is influenza /ˌɪnflʊˈenzə 流感/.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,976
Flu is constantly circulating
between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres /ˈhɛmɪˌsfɪə 半球/.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,976
In North America and Europe,

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,976
seasonal flus occur
every autumn and winter.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,976
As the majority of children and adults will have
been exposed to the virus in previous seasons,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,976
these illnesses are usually mild /maɪld/.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,976
However, every 20 to 40 years or so

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,976
the virus undergoes a dramatic /drəˈmætɪk / mutation /mjuːˈteɪʃən 变异/.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,976
Usually this occurs when a wild flu virus

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,976
circulating in ducks and farm poultry /ˈpəʊltrɪ 家禽/

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,976
meets a pig virus,
and they exchange genes /dʒiːn/.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,976
This process is known as antigenic /ˌæntɪˈdʒenɪk 抗原的/ shift

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,976
and has occurred throughout human history.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,976
The first recorded
pandemic occurred in 1580.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,976
The 18th and 19th centuries

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,976
saw at least six further pandemics.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,976
In terms of mortality,

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,976
none can compare with the Great
Flu Pandemic of 1918.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,976
The first indication of the pandemic

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,976
came in the spring, when American
troops in northern France

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,976
began complaining of chills /tʃɪl 寒冷/,
headaches and fever /ˈfiːvə 发热/.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,976
Then, the following September, at a U.S.
Army barracks /ˈbærək 兵营/ near Boston /ˈbɒstən/,

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,976
soldiers started collapsing /kəˈlæps 倒塌/ on parade /pəˈreɪd 游行/,

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,976
prompting /prɒmpt 提示/ their removal
to the camp infirmary /ɪnˈfɜːmərɪ 医务室/.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,976
As a surgeon there recalled,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,524
two hours after admission, they had
the mahogany /məˈhɒɡənɪ 红褐色/ spots over the cheekbones /ˈtʃiːkˌbəʊn  颧骨/

75
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:37,976
and a few hours later

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,976
you can begin to see the cyanosis /saiəˈnəusis 黄萎病/
extending from their ears

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,976
and spreading all over the face.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,976
It is only a matter of a few hours
then until death comes,

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,976
and it is simply a struggle
for air until they suffocate /ˈsʌfəˌkeɪt 窒息/.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,976
On the S.S. Leviathan,

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,976
a huge American transport
en /en 过程/ route to Bordeaux /bɔːˈdəʊ 波尔多/,

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,976
sick men hemorrhaged /ˈhemərɪdʒ 出血/
blood from their noses,

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,976
turning the decks between their bunks /bʌŋk 铺位/
slick /slɪk 光滑/ with bodily /人体的/ fluids /ˈfluːɪd 液体/.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,976
Meanwhile, British soldiers returning
from northern France on furlough /ˈfɜːləʊ 休假 暂时解雇/

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,976
introduced the flu to Dover /ˈdəʊvə/
and other Channel ports,

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,429
from where the virus
was carried by rail to London.

87
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,976
By the time the pandemic
had run its course

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,976
in April 1919,

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,976
an estimated 675,000 Americans

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,976
and 230,000 Britons were dead.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,976
In India alone, some 10
million were killed,

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,976
and worldwide the death toll
was an astonishing /əˈstɒnɪʃɪŋ 惊人的/ 50 million.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,976
But that was then.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,976
Today, planes can transport viruses

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,976
to any country on the globe

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
in a fraction /ˈfrækʃən 小部分/ of the time it took in 1918.

97
00:05:43,024 --> 00:05:45,976
In February 2003, for instance,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,976
a Chinese doctor arrived
at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,976
feeling unwell.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,976
Unknown to him, he was harboring /hɑ:bəriŋ 怀有/ a new
animal-origin virus called SARS,

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,976
short for Severe /sɪˈvɪə 严重的/ Acute /əˈkjuːt 急剧的/
Respiratory /rəˈspɪrətrəri 呼吸的/ Syndrome /ˈsɪndrəʊm 综合征/.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,976
Within 24 hours of checking into Room 913,

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,976
sixteen other guests had been infected,

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,976
and over the following days five boarded
planes to overseas destinations,

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,976
spreading the virus to Vietnam,
Singapore and Canada.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,976
Flights between Hong Kong, Toronto /təˈrɒntəʊ/ and other
international cities were quickly grounded

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,976
and thanks to other emergency measures,

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,976
a pandemic was averted /əˈvɜːt 避免/.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,976
By the time the outbreak
was over four months later,

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,976
SARS had infected 29 countries worldwide

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,976
and more than 1,000 people were dead.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,976
For all that the virus
was rapidly contained, however,

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,191
there was little that could be done
about the alarming news reports

114
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:51,976
carried by cable news
channels and the Internet.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,976
As bloggers added to the hysteria /hɪˈstɪərɪə 歇斯底里/

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,976
by spreading unfounded
conspiracy /kənˈspɪrəsɪ 阴谋/ theories,

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,048
tourism in Hong Kong and other
affected cities ground to a halt /hɔːlt/,

118
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:05,976
costing businesses more
than 10 billion U.S. dollars.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,976
One business, however, did very well.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,976
Above all, SARS was a reminder that pandemics
have always been associated with panic /ˈpænɪk 惊恐/.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,976
If history teaches us anything,

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
it's that while pandemics may start small,

123
00:07:26,024 --> 00:07:29,976
their impacts can be as dramatic
as wars and natural disasters.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,976
The difference today

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,976
is that science gives us
the ability to detect pandemics

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,976
right at the very beginning

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,976
and to take action
to mitigate /ˈmɪtɪˌɡeɪt 减轻/ their impacts

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,976
before they spread too widely.

129
