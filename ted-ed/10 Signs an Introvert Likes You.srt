1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,239
Introversion is an often misunderstood term.

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,260
because people relate it so much to shyness

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,860
It actually doesn't go by a "one size fits all" definition.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,820
as it can be categorized into four different types

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,180
The four types of introverts can be vaguely described by the traits

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,040
Social

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,820
Thinking

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,260
and anxious and anxious restrained.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,360
Social Introverts

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,040
The belief that social introverts dislike socialization is false.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,800
Rather, they prefer to socialize in small groups of people they feel compatible with

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,400
and comfortable around.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,940
Such as close friends or their family circle.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,880
Thus, they're not exactly shy or reserved.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,620
Thinking Introverts

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,540
These are people who remain introverts in their thinking process

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,540
causing them to be more thoughtful and self-reflective

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,100
For instance, they can get lost in their own dream world.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,940
Drowned in creativity and imagination.

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,220
Anxious Introverts

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,380
Anxious introverts prefer to be alone because they feel uncomfortable or unsuitable during social gatherings

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,240
as they're not confident about their social skills.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,660
Consequently, they are likely to choose solitude

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,340
but sometimes even solitude may not reduce their anxiety

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:35,040
These introverts tend to minimize anxiety by ruminating on things that could've gone wrong had they been in a particular social context.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,900
Restrained Introverts

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,300
These are people who take time in everything they do

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,240
whether it's socializing or springing up in action.

29
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,960
They may seem slow since they think more carefully before they speak or act

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,220
and are more passive in nature than the active types

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,660
Now, you've probably come across an introvert in your life and labeled him or her as so, by identifying a trait that fits in one of the above types.

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,960
So, how do you know whether an introvert likes you or not?

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,340
One

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Making the first move

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,780
Generally,

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,900
introverts don't make the first move in a social context.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,480
but if you find that an introvert is actively making an effort to talk to you or making a gesture to grab your attention

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
you can bet he or she likes you

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,060
Two

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,140
Opening up

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,060
Introverts are not easy to crack

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,340
It takes time for them to come out of their shell and open up about themselves

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,320
However

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,480
if an introvert is telling you a lot about themselves

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,800
you are definitely someone they want to connect with

46
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,240
Three

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Observing

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,900
As introverts are good observers, they're not quick in making friends or including people in their social circle

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,840
They take their time getting to know people and later choose them as friends

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,820
If you find that an introvert is building a good relationship with you

51
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,580
it means he or she wants to be close to you

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,480
Four

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,200
Inviting you into their personal space

54
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,360
Introverts like spending time in solitude to reflect on themselves, their thoughts and emotions

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,560
If you are invited into their personal space and asked to spend time with them

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,680
they no doubt enjoy your company

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,900
Five

58
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,400
Talking about personal topics

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,660
You wouldn't normally find an introvert engaging in a personal conversation

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,060
Instead

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,500
most of their conversations are generic

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,220
but if you come across an introvert that tells you about their likes and dislikes, interests, hobbies, ideologies and goals

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,560
that means they like you to the extent where they feel comfortable doing things that are considered out of character

64
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,960
Six

65
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,040
Showing extra care

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,600
Introverts place high values on relationships

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:58,180
They show a lot of care, concern, and empathy towards people whom they consider friends or significant others through their communications and behaviors

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,140
If an introvert is paying extra attention to you

69
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,360
then, they consider you as part of their close circle of friends

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,580
Seven

71
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,440
Going the extra mile

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,660
Introverts are very warm and helping people

73
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,920
If you find an introvert trying to do  things for you without you asking for help

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
you are someone he or she really likes

75
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,360
Eight

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,660
Constantly keeping in touch

77
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,980
Even introverts distinguish between close and personal friends

78
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,560
If they keep you a part of their daily lives

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,580
then you are someone special to them

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,280
Nine

81
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
Revealing secrets

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,960
Everyone has a secret they keep to themselves

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,820
Introverts especially are very careful about whom they reveal their secrets to

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,020
It can be something like allowing you to read their diary

85
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,920
or sharing and important aspect of their past

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,980
If an introvert is allowing you to know a secret part of their life

87
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,960
you are someone whom they really trust and like

88
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,960
Ten

89
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,480
Giving Feedback

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,180
Introverts don't usually give others advise or feedback

91
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,980
as they keep most of their opinions to themselves

92
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,080
but if you find that an introvert is giving you honest advise or feedback

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,940
they're definitely concerned about you and you're wellbeing.

94
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,440
And those are ten signs an introvert likes you

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,940
Do these traits sound like someone you know?

96
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,080
Do you consider yourself an introvert?

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,700
and if so, can you relate to these traits?
