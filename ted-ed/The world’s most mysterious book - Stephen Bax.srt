1
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:10,689
Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke
Rare Book and Manuscript Library

2
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:14,899
lies the only copy of a 240-page tome /təʊm 册,卷/.

3
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:17,523
Recently carbon dated to around 1420,

4
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,984
its vellum /ˈvɛləm 牛皮纸的/ pages features 
looping handwriting

5
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:23,979
and hand-drawn images seemingly
stolen from a dream.

6
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:25,733
Real and imaginary plants,

7
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,350
floating castles,

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,762
bathing women,

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,263
astrology /əˈstrɒlədʒɪ 占星术/ diagrams /ˈdaɪəˌɡræm 图解，图表/,

10
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,499
zodiac /ˈzəʊdɪˌæk 黄道带/ rings,

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:37,010
and suns and moons with faces
accompany the text.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,540
This 24x16 centimeter book
is called the Voynich manuscript /ˈmænjʊˌskrɪpt 手稿/,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,649
and its one of history's biggest
unsolved mysteries /mistəriz/.

14
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,890
The reason why?

15
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,261
No one can figure out what it says.

16
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,190
The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich,

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,660
a Polish bookseller who came across
the document at a Jesuit college

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,769
in Italy in 1912.

19
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:57,941
He was puzzled.

20
00:00:57,941 --> 00:00:59,011
Who wrote it?

21
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,431
Where was it made?

22
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:04,120
What do these bizarre /bɪˈzɑː 怪诞的/ words
and vibrant /ˈvaɪbrənt 振动的；响亮的；/ drawings represent?

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,691
What secrets do its pages contain?

24
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,671
He purchased the manuscript from
the cash-strapped /拮据/ priest /priːst 牧师/ at the college,

25
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,572
and eventually brought it to the U.S.,

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:16,191
where experts have continued to puzzle
over it for more than a century.

27
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,081
Cryptologists /krɪpˈtɒlədʒɪst/ say the writing has all
the characteristics /ˌkærɪktəˈrɪstɪks/ of a real language,

28
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,651
just one that no one's ever seen before.

29
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:25,391
What makes it seem real is that
in actual languages,

30
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:29,391
letters and groups of letters appear
with consistent frequencies,

31
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:31,511
and the language in the Voynich manuscript

32
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:35,342
has patterns you wouldn't find
from a random letter generator.

33
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:38,712
Other than that, we know little more
than what we can see.

34
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,244
The letters are varied 
in style and height.

35
00:01:41,244 --> 00:01:44,943
Some are borrowed from other scripts,
but many are unique.

36
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:48,262
The taller letters have been named
gallows /ˈɡæləʊz 绞架,绞刑/ characters.

37
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:50,482
The manuscript is 
highly decorated throughout

38
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:52,592
with scroll-like embellishments /ɪmˈbelɪʃmənt 修饰，润色/.

39
00:01:52,592 --> 00:01:55,213
It appears to be written by two
or more hands,

40
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:58,273
with the painting done 
by yet another party.

41
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:03,693
Over the years, three main theories
about the manuscript's text have emerged.

42
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:06,042
The first is that it's written in cypher /=cipher/,

43
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,263
a secret code deliberately /di'libəritli 故意地；从容不迫地/ designed
to hide secret meaning.

44
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,575
The second is that the document is a hoax /həʊks 骗局，恶作剧/

45
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,213
written in gibberish /ˈdʒɪbərɪʃ  令人费解的话；胡言乱语 / to make money
off a gullible /ˈɡʌləbəl 轻信的，易受骗的/ buyer.

46
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:19,133
Some speculate /ˈspɛkjʊˌleɪt 猜测/ the author
was a medieval /ˌmɛdɪˈiːvəl 中世纪的/ con /kɒn  欺诈的/ man.

47
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,793
Others, that it was Voynich himself.

48
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:26,523
The third theory is that the manuscript
is written in an actual language,

49
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,695
but in an unknown script.

50
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,674
Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting
to create an alphabet /ˈælfəˌbɛt 字母表/
51
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:35,123
for a language that was spoken
but not yet written.

52
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:38,844
In that case, the Voynich manuscript
might be like the rongorongo script

53
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,684
invented on Easter Island,

54
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:45,005
now unreadable after the culture
that made it collapsed.

55
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,364
Though no one can read 
the Voynich manuscript,

56
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:50,145
that hasn't stopped people from guessing
what it might say.

57
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,873
Those who believe the manuscript
was an attempt to create

58
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,736
a new form of written language

59
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,995
speculate that it might be an encyclopedia /ɪnˌsaɪkləˈpi:dɪə  百科全书/

60
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,285
containing the knowledge 
of the culture that produced it.

61
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,406
Others believe it was written by 
the 13th century philosopher /fɪˈlɒsəfə 哲学家/ Roger Bacon,

62
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:08,127
who attempted to understand 
the universal laws of grammar,

63
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:12,496
or in the 16th century by the
Elizabethan mystic John Dee,

64
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:15,257
who practiced alchemy /ˈælkəmɪ 炼金术；魔力 / and divination /ˌdɪvɪˈneɪʃən 占卜,卜卦,预测/.

65
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:19,073
More fringe /frɪndʒ 刘海；穗，边缘  次要的/ theories that the book was
written by a coven /ˈkʌvən 女巫大聚会/ of Italian witches,

66
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,296
or even by Martians /ˈmɑːʃən 火星人/.

67
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,116
After 100 years of frustration /frʌˈstreɪʃən 挫败/,

68
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:27,576
scientists have recently shed /ʃɛd 使泄出；流血；/ a little
light on the mystery.

69
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,193
The first breakthrough 
was the carbon dating.

70
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:33,666
Also, contemporary /kənˈtɛmprərɪ 同一时代的/ historians /hɪˈstɔːrɪən/ have
traced the provenance /ˈprɒvɪnəns 起源,出处/ of the manuscript

71
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,546
back through Rome and Prague /prɑːɡ 布拉格/
to as early as 1612,

72
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:41,287
when it was perhaps passed
from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II

73
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,477
to his physician /fɪˈzɪʃən 内科医生/, Jacobus Sinapius.

74
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:46,801
In addition to these 
historical breakthroughs,

75
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:50,527
linguistic researchers recently proposed
the provisional /prəˈvɪʒənəl 暂时的/ identification

76
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,698
of a few of the manuscript's words.

77
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,938
Could the letters beside these seven
stars spell Tauran,

78
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,523
a name for Taurus,

79
00:03:58,523 --> 00:04:02,437
a constellation /ˌkɒnstɪˈleɪʃən 星座 / that includes the seven
stars called the Pleiades?

80
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,807
Could this word be Centaurun
for the Centaurea plant in the picture?

81
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:09,698
Perhaps, but progress is slow.

82
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,527
If we can crack its code,
what might we find?

83
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,959
The dream journal of 
a 15th-century illustrator /ˈɪləˌstreɪtə/?

84
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,692
A bunch of nonsense /ˈnɒnsəns/?

85
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,488
Or the lost knowledge 
of a forgotten culture?

86
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,488
What do you think it is?
