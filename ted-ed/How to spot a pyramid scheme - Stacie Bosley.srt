1
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:08,594
In 2004,

2
00:00:08,594 --> 00:00:10,674
a new company called Vemma Nutrition /njuːˈtrɪʃən/

3
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:13,434
started offering a life-changing 
opportunity

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:17,104
to earn full time income 
for part time work.

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,184
Vemma’s offer was open to everybody,

6
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:22,904
regardless of prior /ˈpraɪə 事先的/ experience 
or education.

7
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:25,374
There were only two steps to start 
get started earning:

8
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:29,434
purchase a $500-600 kit 
of their liquid nutrition products,

9
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:32,584
and recruit /rɪˈkruːt/ two more members 
to do the same.

10
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:34,845
Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly,

11
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,395
becoming a global operation

12
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:41,145
that brought in 30,000 new members 
per month at its peak.

13
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,841
There was just one problem—

14
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:48,611
while the company generated $200 million
of annual revenue by 2013,

15
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:52,865
the vast majority of participants 
earned less than they paid in.

16
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:56,226
Vemma was eventually charged with 
operating a pyramid scheme:

17
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,556
a common type of fraud

18
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:58,826
where members make money

19
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,736
by recruiting more people to buy in.

20
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:04,605
Typically, the founder solicits /səˈlɪsɪt 拉客/ an initial
group of people

21
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,956
to buy in and promote the scheme.

22
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,896
They are then encouraged to recruit others

23
00:01:08,896 --> 00:01:12,116
and promised part of the money 
those people invest,

24
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,996
while the founder also takes a share.

25
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,846
The pattern repeats for each group 
of new participants,

26
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:21,946
with money from recent arrivals funneled /ˈfʌnəl 漏斗/ 
to those who recruited them.

27
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:23,795
This differs from a Ponzi scheme,

28
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:25,605
where the founders recruit new members

29
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,915
and secretly use their fees to 
pay existing members,

30
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:32,465
who think the payments come 
from a legitimate /lɪˈdʒɪtɪmɪt/ investment.

31
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:34,445
As a pyramid scheme grows,

32
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,905
it becomes increasingly difficult for new 
recruits to make money.

33
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:42,225
That’s because the number of participants
expands exponentially /ˌekspəˈnenʃəlɪ  以指数方式/.

34
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:46,965
Take a structure where each person has 
to recruit six more to earn a profit.

35
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:49,400
The founder recruits six people to start,

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,810
and each of them recruits six more.

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,940
There are 36 people in that second
round of recruits,

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,490
who then each recruit 6 people—

39
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,150
a total of 216 new recruits.

40
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,100
By the twelfth round of recruiting,

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,100
the 2.1 billion newest members 
would have to recruit

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,000
over 13 billion more people total 
to make money–

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,120
more than the entire world population.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,250
In this scenario sɪˈnɑːrɪˌəʊ 剧本,

45
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,750
the most recent recruits,

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,850
over 80% of the scheme’s participants,

47
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,480
lose all the money they paid in.

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,940
And in real life,

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,030
many earlier joiners lose out too.

50
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,820
Pyramid schemes are illegal 
in most countries,

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,910
but they can be difficult to detect.

52
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,259
They are presented as many 
different things,

53
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,049
including gifting groups,

54
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,679
investment clubs, and multi-level 
marketing businesses.

55
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:44,119
The distinction between pyramid schemes 
and legitimate /lɪˈdʒɪtɪmɪt/ multi-level marketing

56
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:46,089
can be particularly hazy /ˈheɪzɪ 模糊的/.

57
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,659
In theory, the difference is that

58
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,239
the members of the multi-level 
marketing companies

59
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,619
primarily /ˈpraɪmərəlɪ 主要地 / earn compensation /ˌkɒmpɛnˈseɪʃən 补偿金 / from selling
a particular product or a service

60
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,103
to retail customers,

61
00:02:56,103 --> 00:03:01,063
while pyramid schemes primarily compensate /ˈkɒmpenseɪt 补偿/
members for recruitment of new sellers.

62
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,380
In practice, though,

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,670
many multi-level marketing companies make 
it all but impossible

64
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,400
for members to profit purely 
through sales.

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,510
And many pyramid schemes, 
like Vemma Nutrition,

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,320
disguise /dɪsˈɡaɪz 伪装/ themselves as legal multi-level
marketing businesses,

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,790
using a product or service to hide the
pay-and-recruit structure.

68
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:25,413
Many pyramid schemes also capitalize  /ˈkæpɪtəlaɪz 资本化/
on already existing trust within churches /tʃɜːtʃɪs 教堂/,

69
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,611
immigrant /ˈɪmɪɡrənt 外来移民/ communities, 
or other tightly /ˈtaɪtli 紧紧地/ knit /nɪt 编织/ groups.

70
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:32,291
The first few members are encouraged 
to report a good experience

71
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,641
before they actually start 
making a profit.

72
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:37,171
Others in their network follow 
their example /ɪɡˈzæmpl/,

73
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,311
and the schemes balloon /bəˈluːn/ in size

74
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:43,521
before it comes clear that most members
aren’t actually profiting.

75
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,766
Often, the victims are 
embarrassed /ɪmˈbærəst 尴尬的/ into silence.

76
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:51,176
Pyramid schemes entice /ɪnˈtaɪs 诱使/ people with the
promise of opportunity and empowerment / ɪmˈpaʊəmənt 许可/.

77
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:53,586
So when members don’t end up making money,

78
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:56,566
they can blame themselves 
rather than the scheme,

79
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:00,326
thinking they weren’t tenacious /tɪˈneɪʃəs 固执的/ enough 
to earn the returns promised.

80
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,076
Some victims keep trying,

81
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,146
investing in multiple schemes,

82
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,636
and losing money each time.

83
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:08,472
In spite of all these factors,

84
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,492
there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme.

85
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,772
Time pressure is one red flag—

86
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:19,232
be wary /ˈweəri 谨慎地/ of directives to “act now or 
miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

87
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:24,392
Promises of large, life-altering
amounts of income /ˈɪnkʌm/ are also suspect.

88
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:28,170
And finally, a legitimate multi-level 
marketing business

89
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,440
shouldn’t require members to pay for the
opportunity to sell a product or service.

90
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,380
Pyramid schemes can be incredibly 
destructive to individuals,

91
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,980
communities, and even entire countries.

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,830
But you can fight fire with fire

93
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,274
by sending this video to three 
people you know,

94
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:50,274
and encouraging them to do the same.
