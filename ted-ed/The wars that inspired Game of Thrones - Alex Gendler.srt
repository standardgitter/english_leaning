1
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,402
As far as we know,

2
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:12,472
Medieval /ˌmɛdɪˈiːvəl 中世纪的/ England was never invaded
by ice zombies /ˈzɒmbɪ /,

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,729
or terrorized /ˈterəˌraɪz/ by dragons,

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:19,345
but it was shaken by a power struggle
between two noble /ˈnəʊbəl 贵族/ families

5
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,110
spanning generations

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,904
and involving a massive 
cast of characters

7
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:28,018
with complex motives 
and shifting loyalties.

8
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:29,754
If that sounds familiar,

9
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:33,959
it's because the historical conflicts
known as the Wars of the Roses

10
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:39,908
served as the basis for much 
of the drama in Game of Thrones.

11
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:47,097
The real-life seeds /siːd 种子；萌芽/ of war were sewn  /sew səʊ过去式/səʊn 缝；缝制 /
by the death of King Edward III in 1377.

12
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:50,890
Edward's oldest son 
had died before his father,

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,879
but his ten-year-old son, Richard II,

14
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,179
succeeded to the throne 
ahead of Edward's three surviving sons.

15
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,603
This skipping of an entire generation

16
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:06,396
left lingering /ˈlɪŋɡə 拖延的/ claims to the throne
among their various offspring /ˈɒfˌsprɪŋ 子女；子孙；后代/,

17
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:10,926
particularly the Lancasters,
descended /dɪˈsɛnd 是…的后裔 下降 / from Edward's third son,

18
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:14,366
and the Yorks, descended 
from his fourth son.

19
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,195
The name of the ensuing /ɪnˈsjuː 接着发生/ wars

20
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:19,501
comes from the symbols 
associated with the two families,

21
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:24,128
the white rose of York
and the red rose of Lancaster.

22
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:26,239
The Lancasters first gained the throne

23
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,340
when Richard II was deposed /dɪˈpəʊz 免职，废黜；（宣誓）作证/
by his cousin Henry IV in 1399.

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,496
Despite sporadic /spəˈrædɪk 间断发生的；零星的 / unrest / ʌnˈrest  动乱，骚乱/,

25
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:38,476
their reign /reɪn 支配，统治/ remained secure until 1422,

26
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,429
when Henry V's death 
in a military campaign

27
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,227
left an infant Henry VI as king.

28
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:47,785
Weak-willed and dominated by advisors,

29
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:53,350
Henry was eventually convinced to marry
Margaret of Anjou to gain French support.

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,424
Margaret was beautiful, ambitious,

31
00:01:56,424 --> 00:02:00,350
and ruthless /ˈruːθlɪs 无情的/ in persecuting / ˈpɜːsɪˌkjuːt 迫害；困扰/
any threat to her power,

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,723
and she distrusted 
Richard of York, most of all.

33
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,056
York had been the King's close advisor
and loyal General,

34
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:10,103
but was increasingly 
sidelined /ˈsaɪdˌlaɪn  使退出 局外/ by the Queen,

35
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:15,048
who promoted her favorite supporters,
like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset.

36
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:18,852
York's criticism of their inept /ɪnˈept 能的；笨拙的/ handling
of the war against France

37
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:23,975
led to his exclusion from court
and transfer to Ireland.

38
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,297
Meanwhile, mounting military failures,

39
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:29,436
and corrupt /kəˈrʌpt 腐化/ rule by Margaret 
and her allies

40
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:31,875
caused widespread discontent,

41
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,748
and in the midst of this chaos,

42
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:39,749
Richard of York returned with an army
to arrest Somerset and reform the court.

43
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,475
Initially unsuccessful, 
he soon got his chance

44
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,407
when he was appointed 
Protector of the Realm

45
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:48,135
after Henry suffered a mental breakdown.

46
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,428
However, less than a year later,

47
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:52,056
Henry suddendly recovered

48
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,651
and the Queen convinced him 
to reverse York's reforms.

49
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,896
York fled /flee/ and raised an army once more.

50
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,497
Though he was unable 
to directly seize /siːz 夺取/ the throne,

51
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:04,243
he managed to be reinstated /ˌriːɪnˈsteɪt 使复原/ as Protector

52
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:09,726
and have himself and his heirs /ɛə 继承人/ designated /ˈdɛzɪɡˌneɪtɪd 指定的，特指的/
to succeed Henry.

53
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,329
But instead of a crown /kraʊn/,

54
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,755
York's head acquired a pike /paɪk  矛  刺杀/

55
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:17,805
after he was killed in battle
with the Queen's loyalists.

56
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:22,716
His young son took up the claim
and was crowned Edward IV.

57
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,353
Edward enjoyed great military success
against the Lancasters.

58
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,987
Henry was captured /俘虏/,

59
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:30,232
while Margaret fled into exile /ˈɛɡzaɪl 流放/

60
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:34,112
with their reportedly cruel /ˈkruːəl 残忍的/ son, 
Edward of Westminster.

61
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:37,587
But the newly crowned King
made a tragic political mistake

62
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:41,570
by backing out of his arranged marriage
with a French Princess

63
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,066
to secretly marry the widow
of a minor /ˈmaɪnə 未成年/ Noble.

64
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,947
This alienated /ˈeɪljəˌneɪt 使疏远；转让/ his most powerful ally /ˈælaɪ 同盟/,
the Earl of Warwick.

65
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,043
Warwick allied with the Lancasters,

66
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,835
turned Edward's jealous 
younger brother, George, against him,

67
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:00,324
and even briefly managed 
to restore Henry as King,

68
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,890
but it didn't last.

69
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,631
Edward recaptured the throne,

70
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:06,369
the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle,

71
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:11,122
and Henry himself died 
in captivity not long after.

72
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:13,839
The rest of Edward IV's reign 
was peaceful,

73
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:18,077
but upon his death in 1483, 
the bloodshed /ˈblʌdˌʃɛd 流血事件/ resumed.

74
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:20,970
Though his twelve-year-old son
was due to succeed him,

75
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:25,634
Edward's younger brother Richard III
declared his nephews /ˈnefjuː  侄子；外甥/ illegitimate /ˌɪlɪˈdʒɪtɪmɪt 私生的；非法的；/

76
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:28,545
due to their father's secret marriage.

77
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:32,848
He assumed the regency /ˈriːdʒənsɪ 摄政统治,摄政权/ himself
and threw the boys in prison.

78
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,325
Though no one knows what ultimately
became of them,

79
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,065
after a while, the Princes disappeared

80
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,816
and Richard's power seemed secure.

81
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,523
But his downfall /ˈdaʊnˌfɔːl 垮台/ would come
only two years later

82
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:47,768
from across the narrow sea
of the English Channel.

83
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:51,878
Henry Tudor was a direct descendant /dɪˈsɛndənt 后代/
of the first Duke of Lancaster,

84
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:56,010
raised in exile after his father's 
death in a previous rebellion /rɪˈbɛljən 造反，叛乱/.

85
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,157
With Richard III's power grab
causing a split in the York faction /ˈfækʃən 派别；内讧；纪实小说/,

86
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:03,559
Henry won support for his royal claim.

87
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:07,702
Raising an army in France,
he crossed the Channel in 1485

88
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,679
and quickly defeated Richard's forces.

89
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:15,303
And by marrying Elizabeth of York,
elder sister of the disappeared Princes,

90
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:20,021
the newly crowned Henry VII
joined the two roses,

91
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:23,908
finally ending nearly a century of war.

92
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:28,220
We often think of historical wars
as decisive /dɪˈsaɪsɪv 决定性的；关键的/ conflicts

93
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,979
with clearly defined winners and losers.

94
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,318
But the Wars of the Roses,
like the fiction /ˈfɪkʃən 虚构小说/ they inspired,

95
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:37,147
show us that victories
can be uncertain,

96
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,323
alliances unstable,

97
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:44,323
and even the power of Kings
as fleeting as the seasons.
