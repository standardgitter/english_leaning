1
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:09,599
A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone

2
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:12,312
winds /曲折而行/ its way through
the countryside of China

3
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:16,423
with a history almost as long
and serpentine /ˈsɜːpənˌtaɪn 蜿蜒的/ as the structure.

4
00:00:16,447 --> 00:00:19,283
The Great Wall began as multiple walls
of rammed /ræm 夯实的/ earth

5
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:23,236
built by individual feudal /ˈfjuːdəl 封建时代的/ states
during the Chunqiu period

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,386
to protect against nomadic /nəʊˈmædɪk 游牧的/ raiders /ˈreɪdə 侵入者/
north of China and each other.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:32,189
When Emperor Qin Shi Huang
unified /ˈjuːnɪˌfaɪ 统一/ the states in 221 BCE,

8
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:36,458
the Tibetan /tɪˈbetən/ Plateau /ˈplætəʊ 高原/ and Pacific Ocean
became natural barriers /ˈbærɪə 屏障/,

9
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,904
but the mountains in the north
remained vulnerable

10
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:42,145
to Mongol /ˈmɒŋɡɒl/, Turkish /ˈtɜːkɪʃ/, and Xiongnu invasions.

11
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:44,428
To defend against them,

12
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:47,517
the Emperor expanded the small walls
built by his predecessors /ˈpriːdɪˌsɛsə 前任，前辈/,

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,275
connecting some and fortifying /ˈfɔːtɪˌfaɪ 加固/ others.

14
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,108
As the structures grew
from Lintao in the west

15
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,353
to Liaodong in the east,

16
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:59,372
they collectively became known
as The Long Wall.

17
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:00,784
To accomplish this task,

18
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:03,228
the Emperor enlisted /ɪnˈlɪst 征募/ soldiers /ˈsəʊldʒə/
and commoners /ˈkɒmənə 平民/,

19
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,087
not always voluntarily /ˈvɒləntərɪlɪ 志愿地/.

20
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:09,976
Of the hundreds of thousands of builders
recorded during the Qin Dynasty,

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,346
many were forcibly /fɔ:səbli 强制地/ conscripted /ˈkɒnskrɪpt 征召/ peasants /ˈpezənt 农夫/

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,246
and others were criminals
serving out sentences.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,617
Under the Han Dynasty,
the wall grew longer still,

24
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,060
reaching 3700 miles,

25
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:25,173
and spanning /spæn/ from Dunhuang
to the Bohai Sea.

26
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:28,959
Forced labor continued
under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi ,

27
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:33,302
and the walls reputation grew
into a notorious /nəʊˈtɔːrɪəs 臭名昭著的/ place of suffering.

28
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,418
Poems and legends of the time
told of laborers buried /ˈberɪ/

29
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,251
in nearby mass /mæs/ graves /ɡreɪv 坟/,

30
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,409
or even within the wall itself.

31
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,981
And while no human remains
have been found inside,

32
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,803
grave pits /pɪt 坑/ do indicate /ˈɪndɪˌkeɪt 指示/
that many workers died

33
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,465
from accidents, hunger and exhaustion.

34
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:53,132
The wall was formidable /fɔːˈmɪdəbəl 令人生畏/
but not invincible /ɪnˈvɪnsɪbəl 不可战胜/.

35
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:56,516
Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan
managed to surmount /sɜːˈmaʊnt 攻克/ the wall

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,637
during the Mongol invasion
of the 13th Century.

37
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,667
After the Ming dynasty
gained control in 1368,

38
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,234
they began to refortify /riːˈfɔːtɪˌfaɪ 使再加固/
and further consolidate /kənˈsɒlɪˌdeɪt 加强/ the wall

39
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:09,901
using bricks and stones from local kilns /kɪln 窑,炉/.

40
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:13,698
Averaging /平均/ 23 feet high and 21 feet wide,

41
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:18,860
the walls 5500 miles
were punctuated /ˈpʌŋktjʊˌeɪt 不时打断/ by watchtowers.

42
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:20,219
When raiders /ˈreɪdə 侵入者/ were sighted,

43
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,886
fire and smoke signals traveled
between towers

44
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,554
until reinforcements /援军/ arrived.

45
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:29,250
Small openings along the wall
let archers /ˈɑːtʃə 弓箭手/ fire on invaders,

46
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,140
while larger ones were used
to drop stones and more.

47
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:36,670
But even this new and improved wall
was not enough.

48
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:41,040
In 1644, northern Manchu clans /klæn 部落/
overthrew /ˌəʊvəˈθrəʊ 推翻/ the Ming

49
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:43,672
to establish the Qing dynasty,

50
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,956
incorporating Mongolia as well,

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,499
Thus, for the second time,

52
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:51,484
China was ruled by the very people
the wall had tried to keep out.

53
00:02:51,508 --> 00:02:54,502
With the empire's /ˈɛmpaɪə 帝国/ borders
now extending beyond the Great Wall,

54
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:57,465
the fortifications /ˌfɔːtɪfɪˈkeɪʃən 防御工事/ lost their purpose.

55
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,961
And without regular reinforcement,
the wall fell into disrepair /失修/,

56
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,307
rammed /ræm 夯实/ earth eroded /ɪˈrəʊd 腐蚀/,

57
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:06,593
while brick and stone were plundered /ˈplʌndə 掠夺/
for building materials.

58
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,197
But its job wasn't finished.

59
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,858
During World War II,

60
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:12,729
China used sections for defense
against Japanese invasion,

61
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:16,798
and some parts are still rumored /ˈruːmə 谣言/
to be used for military training.

62
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,466
But the Wall's main purpose
today is cultural.

63
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,030
As one of the largest man-made
structures on Earth,

64
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:27,282
it was granted UNESCO
World Heritage /ˈher.ɪ.tɪdʒ 遗产/ Status in 1987.

65
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,975
Originally built to keep
people out of China,

66
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,481
the Great Wall now welcomes
millions of visitors each year.

67
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:37,657
In fact, the influx /ˈɪnˌflʌks 涌入/ of tourists
has caused the wall to deteriorate /dɪˈtɪərɪəˌreɪt 恶化/,

68
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:40,838
leading the Chinese government
to launch preservation /ˌprɛzəˈveɪʃən 保存/ initiatives /ɪˈnɪʃɪətɪv 主动性/ .

69
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:45,875
It's also often acclaimed /əˈkleɪm 称赞/ as the only
man-made structure visible from space.

70
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,518
Unfortunately, that's not at all true.

71
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,706
In low Earth orbit /ˈɔːbɪt/,
all sorts of structures,

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,684
like bridges, highways
and airports are visible,

73
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,796
and the Great Wall
is only barely /ˈbɛəlɪ 几乎不/ discernible /dɪˈsɜːnəbəl 看得清的/.

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,945
From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance /有机会/.

75
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,132
But regardless, it's the Earth
we should be studying it from

76
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:07,506
because new sections
are still discovered every few years,

77
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,114
branching /brɑːntʃ 分支/ off from the main body

78
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:12,138
and expanding this remarkable
monument /ˈmɒnjʊmənt 纪念碑 遗迹/ to human achievement.
