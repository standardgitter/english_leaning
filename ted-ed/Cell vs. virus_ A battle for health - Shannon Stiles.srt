1
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:09,585
You're in line at the grocery /ˈɡrəʊsərɪ/ store when, uh oh,

2
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,275
someone sneezes /sniːz 打喷嚏/ on you.

3
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:13,736
The cold virus is sucked inside your lungs

4
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:16,487
and lands on a cell on your airway lining.

5
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:19,040
Every living thing on Earth is made of cells,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,073
from the smallest one-celled bacteria /bækˈtɪərɪə 细菌/

7
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,852
to the giant blue whale to you.

8
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:27,190
Each cell in your body is surrounded by a cell membrane /ˈmɛmbreɪn 膜/,

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,278
a thick flexible layer made of fats and proteins,

10
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,475
that surrounds and protects the inner components /kəmˈpəʊnənt/.

11
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:34,493
It's semipermeable /semi'pə:miəbl 半透的/,

12
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,048
meaning that it lets some thing pass in and out

13
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:38,402
but blocks others.

14
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:41,495
The cell membrane /ˈmɛmbreɪn 膜/ is covered with tiny projections /prəˈdʒɛkʃən 突出 投射/.

15
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:42,752
They all have functions,

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,728
like helping cells adhere /ədˈhɪə 黏附/ to their neighbors

17
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:47,785
or binding to nutrients /ˈnjuːtrɪənt 营养品/ the cell will need.

18
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:50,062
Animal and plant cells have cell membranes.

19
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:52,052
Only plant cells have a cell wall,

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,048
which is made of rigid /ˈrɪdʒɪd 坚硬的/ cellulose /ˈsɛljʊˌləʊz 纤维素/ that gives the plant structure.

21
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:59,414
The virus cell that was sneezed into your lungs is sneaky /ˈsniːkɪ 鬼鬼祟祟的/.

22
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,584
Pretending /prɪˈtɛnd 伪装/ to be a friend,

23
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:03,548
it attaches to a projection on the cell membrane,

24
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:06,954
and the cell brings it through the cell membrane and inside.

25
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:08,330
When the virus gets through,

26
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,220
the cell recognizes its mistake.

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,172
An enemy is inside!

28
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,010
Special enzymes /ˈenzaɪm 酶/ arrive at the scene

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,224
and chop the virus to pieces.

30
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,043
They then send one of the pieces back

31
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:19,379
through the cell membrane,

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,063
where the cell displays it to warn neighboring cells

33
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:23,717
about the invader.

34
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,332
A nearby cell sees the warning

35
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:27,810
and immediately goes into action.

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,419
It needs to make antibodies /ˈæntɪˌbɒdɪ 抗体/,

37
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,189
proteins that will attack and kill

38
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,068
the invading virus.

39
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,656
This process starts in the nucleus /ˈnjuːklɪəs 细胞核/.

40
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:37,667
The nucleus contains our DNA,

41
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:40,390
the blueprint that tells our cells how to make everything

42
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,290
our bodies need to function.

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,128
A certain section of our DNA contains instructions

44
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:49,279
that tell our cells how to make antibodies.

45
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,329
Enzymes /ˈenzaɪm 酶/ in the nucleus /ˈnjuːklɪəs 细胞核/ find the right section of DNA,

46
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,138
then create a copy of these instructions,

47
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:56,427
called messenger RNA.

48
00:01:56,427 --> 00:02:00,423
The messenger RNA leaves the nucleus to carry out its orders.

49
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:03,467
The messenger RNA travels to a ribosome /ˈraɪbəˌsəʊm 核糖体/.

50
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,907
There can be as many as 10 million ribosomes /ˈraɪbəˌsəʊm 核糖体/

51
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,302
in a human cell,

52
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:09,140
all studded /stʌd 饰钉 布满/ along a ribbon/ˈrɪbən 缎带/-like structure

53
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,673
called the endoplasmic /ˌendəʊˈplæzmɪk 内质的/ reticulum /riˈtikjuləm 网状组织/.

54
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,914
This ribosome /ˈraɪbəˌsəʊm 核糖体/ reads the instructions from the nucleus.

55
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:18,091
It takes amino /əˈmaɪnəʊ 氨基的/ acids /ˈæsɪd 酸/ and links them together one by one

56
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:22,003
creating an antibody protein that will go fight the virus.

57
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:23,237
But before it can do that,

58
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:25,776
the antibody needs to leave the cell.

59
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,649
The antibody heads to the golgi /ɡɔ:ldʒi 高尔基体/ apparatus /ˌæpəˈreɪtəs 仪器 机构/.

60
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,717
Here, it's packed up for delivery outside the cell.

61
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:35,118
Enclosed in a bubble made of the same material as the cell membrane,

62
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:38,798
the golgi apparatus also gives the antibody directions,

63
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:41,355
telling it how to get to the edge of the cell.

64
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:42,184
When it gets there,

65
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:45,975
the bubble surrounding the antibody fuses /fjuːz 熔化/ to the cell membrane.

66
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,954
The cell ejects /ɪˈdʒɛkt 驱逐 弹射出/ the antibody,

67
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:50,584
and it heads out to track /træk 跟踪/ down the virus.

68
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,390
The leftover /ˈleftˌəʊvə 剩余的/ bubble will be broken down

69
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,980
by the cell's lysosomes /ˈlaɪsəˌsəʊm 溶酶体/

70
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,916
and its pieces recycled over and over again.

71
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,079
Where did the cell get the energy to do all this?

72
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,401
That's the roll of the mitochondria /ˌmaɪtəʊˈkɒndrɪə 线粒体/.

73
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:04,719
To make energy, the mitochondria /ˌmaɪtəʊˈkɒndrɪə 线粒体/ takes oxygen,

74
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,366
this is the only reason we breathe /briːð 呼吸/ it,

75
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,386
and adds electrons /ɪˈlɛktrɒn 电子/ from the food we eat

76
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,457
to make water molecules /ˈmɒlɪˌkjuːl 分子/.

77
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,882
That process also creates a high energy molecule /ˈmɒlɪˌkjuːl 分子/,

78
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:18,244
called ATP which the cell uses to power all of its parts.

79
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:20,964
Plant cells make energy a different way.

80
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:22,103
They have chloroplasts /ˈklɔːrəʊˌplæst 叶绿体/

81
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,205
that combine carbon dioxide /daɪˈɒksaɪd 二氧化物/ and water

82
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,048
with light energy from the sun

83
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,769
to create oxygen and sugar,

84
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,345
a form of chemical energy.

85
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,294
All the parts of a cell have to work together

86
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,532
to keep things running smoothly,

87
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:36,646
and all the cells of your body have to work together

88
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:38,949
to keep you running smoothly.

89
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,520
That's a whole lot of cells.

90
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,232
Scientists think there are about 37 trillion of them.
