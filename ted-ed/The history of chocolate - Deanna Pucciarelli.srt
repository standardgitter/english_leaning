1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,923
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate,

2
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:15,942
you're lucky you weren't born before the 16th century.

3
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:19,450
Until then, chocolate only existed in Mesoamerica /ˌmesəʊəˈmerɪkə 中美洲/

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,305
in a form quite different from what we know.

5
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,685
As far back as 1900 BCE,

6
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:27,805
the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans

7
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,716
of the native /ˈneɪtɪv/ cacao /kəˈkɑːəʊ 可可树/ tree.

8
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:33,216
The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground

9
00:00:33,216 --> 00:00:36,465
and mixed with cornmeal /ˈkɔːnˌmiːl 玉米粉/
and chili /ˈtʃɪlɪ 红辣椒/ peppers /ˈpepə/

10
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:37,956
to create a drink -

11
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:40,096
not a relaxing /rɪˈlæksɪŋ/ cup of hot cocoa /ˈkəʊkəʊ/,

12
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:44,736
but a bitter /ˈbɪtə 苦味/, invigorating /ɪnˈvɪɡəˌreɪt 使精力充沛/ concoction /kənˈkɒkʃən  调制品/
frothing /frɒθ 使起泡沫/ with foam /fəum/.

13
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:47,976
And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today,

14
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:51,166
the Mesoamericans /ˌmesəʊəˈmerɪkən 中美洲/ had us beat /biːt/.

15
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,596
They believed that cacao /kəˈkɑːəʊ 可可树/
was a heavenly /ˈhɛvənlɪ 神圣的/ food

16
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:57,016
gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent /ˈsɜːpənt 蛇/ god,

17
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,539
known to the Maya /ˈmɑˌjɑ/ as Kukulkan

18
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,836
and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl.

19
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:05,287
Aztecs used cacao /kəˈkɑːəʊ 可可树/ beans as currency /ˈkɜrənsi 货币/

20
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,826
and drank chocolate at royal /ˈrɔɪəl/ feasts /fiːst/,

21
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:10,736
gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle,

22
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,417
and used it in rituals /ˈrɪtjʊəl 仪式上的/.

23
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:18,137
The first transatlantic /ˌtrænzətˈlæntɪk 横跨大西洋的/
chocolate encounter /ɪnˈkaʊntə 遭遇/ occurred in 1519

24
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:21,727
when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma

25
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:23,486
at Tenochtitlan.

26
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:25,587
As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant /luːˈtenənt 海军上尉/,

27
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:31,287
the king had 50 jugs /dʒʌɡ 罐，壶/ of the drink
brought out and poured /pɔː/ into golden cups.

28
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:34,707
When the colonists /ˈkɒlənɪst 殖民者/  returned with shipments
of the strange new bean,

29
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:37,727
missionaries' /ˈmɪʃənərɪ 传教士/ salacious /səˈleɪʃəs 淫秽的/ accounts /解释/
of native customs

30
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:42,068
gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac /ˌæfrəˈdɪzɪæk 春药/.

31
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,778
At first, its bitter /ˈbɪtə 苦味/ taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments /ˈeɪlmənt 小病/,

32
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,978
like upset /ʌpˈsɛt 不适/ stomachs /ˈstʌmək/,

33
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:50,777
but sweetening it with honey /ˈhʌnɪ/,
sugar, or vanilla /vəˈnɪlə 香草/

34
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,458
quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy /ˈdɛlɪkəsɪ  精致/
in the Spanish court /kɔːt 宫廷/.

35
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:01,568
And soon, no aristocratic /ˌærɪstəˈkrætɪk 贵族的/ home was
complete without dedicated /ˈdɛdɪˌkeɪtɪd 专用的/ chocolate ware /wɛə  制品，物品/.

36
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:05,378
The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce

37
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,859
on a large scale /skeɪl/.

38
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,369
That involved using plantations /种植园/
and imported slave labor /ˈleɪbə/

39
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,509
in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa.

40
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,179
The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:24,029
with the introduction of the cocoa /ˈkəʊkəʊ/ press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam.

42
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:28,531
Van Houten's invention could separate /ˈseprət 分离/
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter.

43
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:32,516
This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution

44
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:34,989
or recombined /rikəmˈbaɪn 调配/ with the cocoa butter

45
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,209
to create the solid /ˈsɒlɪd/ chocolate
we know today.

46
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,202
Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier /ˌtʃɒkəˈlætɪə 巧克力制造商/
named Daniel Peter

47
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:44,701
added powdered milk to the mix,

48
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,790
thus inventing milk chocolate.

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,389
By the 20th century /ˈsɛntʃərɪ/, chocolate
was no longer an elite /ɪˈliːt/ luxury /ˈlʌkʃərɪ/

50
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,851
but had become a treat for the public.

51
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:58,114
Meeting the massive /ˈmæsɪv 大规模/ demand required
more cultivation /ˌkʌltɪˈveɪʃən 栽培/ of cocoa,

52
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:00,815
which can only grow near the equator /ɪˈkweɪtə 赤道/.

53
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,731
Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped

54
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,021
to South American cocoa plantations,

55
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:09,151
cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa

56
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:14,701
with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015.

57
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,744
Yet along with the growth
of the industry,

58
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:19,977
there have been horrific /həˈrɪfɪk 极其可怕的 / abuses /əˈbjuːz/
of human rights.

59
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:22,230
Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa,

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,260
which supply Western companies,

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,731
use slave and child labor,

62
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:31,942
with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected.

63
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,951
This is a complex problem
that persists /pəˈsɪst 固执/

64
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:38,981
despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations

65
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,901
to reduce child 
and indentured /ɪnˈdɛntʃə 契约/ labor practices /ˈpræktɪs/.

66
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:47,792
Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals /ˈrɪtjʊəl 例行公事/ of our modern culture.

67
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:51,442
Due to its colonial /kəˈləʊnɪəl 殖民（地）的/ association with
native cultures,

68
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,892
combined /kəmˈbaɪn/ with the power of advertising,

69
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:57,113
chocolate retains /rɪˈteɪn 保存/ an aura /ˈɔːrə 给人的感觉 特质/
of something sensual /ˈsɛnsjʊəl 激起性欲的/,

70
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,212
decadent /ˈdɛkədənt 堕落的/,

71
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,663
and forbidden.

72
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:03,471
Yet knowing more about its fascinating /ˈfæsɪˌneɪtɪŋ 迷人的/
and often cruel /ˈkruːəl 残忍的；残酷的/ history,

73
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:05,562
as well as its production today,

74
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:08,642
tells us where 
these associations originate /əˈrɪdʒɪˌneɪt v 起源/

75
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:11,052
and what they hide.

76
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,912
So as you unwrap  /ʌnˈræp/
your next bar of chocolate,

77
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:20,912
take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.
