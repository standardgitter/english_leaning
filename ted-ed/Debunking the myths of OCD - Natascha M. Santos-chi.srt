00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:08,269
Debunking /diːˈbʌŋk 揭穿/ the myths of OCD
There's a common misconception /ˌmɪskənˈsɛpʃən 错觉/

2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,000
that if you like to meticulously  /məˈtɪkjʊləslɪ 异常细致地/
organize your things,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,573
keep your hands clean,

4
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:15,727
or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail,

5
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:19,152
you might have OCD.

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:24,129
In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive /əbˈsɛsɪv 强迫症患者 强迫性的/ compulsive /kəmˈpʌlsɪv 极有趣的，令人着迷的；强迫性的 / disorder,

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,348
is a serious psychiatric /ˌsaɪkɪˈætrɪk 精神疾病的/ condition

8
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:28,623
that is frequently 
misunderstood by society

9
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:31,739
and mental health professionals alike.

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,669
So let's start by debunking /diːˈbʌŋk 揭穿/ some myths.

11
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:40,318
Myth one: repetitive /repetitive 重复的，啰嗦的/ or ritualistic /ˌrɪtjʊəˈlɪstɪk 仪式的/
behaviors are synonymous /sɪˈnɒnɪməs 同义的/ with OCD.

12
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:41,951
As its name suggests,

13
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:45,102
obsessive /əbˈsɛsɪv 强迫症患者 强迫性的/ compulsive /kəmˈpʌlsɪv 极有趣的，令人着迷的；强迫性的 / disorder
has two aspects /ˈæspɛkt 特征/:

14
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:50,106
the intrusive /ɪnˈtruːsɪv 侵入的/ thoughts, images,
or impulses /ˈɪmpʌls  冲动/, known as obsessions /əbˈsɛʃən 强迫症/,

15
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,413
and the behavioral  /bɪˈheɪvjərəl/
compulsions /kəmˈpʌlʃən/ people engage in

16
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:56,942
to relieve /rɪˈliːv 缓解/ the anxiety /æŋˈzaɪɪtɪ/
the obsessions cause.

17
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:00,217
The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD,

18
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:04,078
like excessive /ɪkˈsɛsɪv 过多的/ hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly,

19
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:08,029
may be examples of obsessive /əbˈsɛsɪv/
or compulsive tendencies /ˈtɛndənsɪ 趋势/

20
00:01:08,029 --> 00:01:10,847
that many of us exhibit from time to time.

21
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:16,264
But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating /dɪˈbɪlɪˌteɪt 使虚弱/.

22
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:20,279
People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts

23
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,333
and compulsive behaviors,

24
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,108
which tend to be time consuming

25
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:28,405
and interfere with work, 
school or social life

26
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,230
to the point of causing 
significant /sɪɡˈnɪfɪkənt/ distress /dɪˈstrɛs 忧虑/.

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,506
This set of diagnostic /daɪəɡˈnɒstɪk 诊断的/ criteria /kraɪˈtɪərɪə<复> OR kraɪˈtɪərɪən 标准/ is what
separates people suffering from OCD

28
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:39,702
from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous /məˈtɪkjʊləs 讲究细节的/

29
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:42,488
or hygiene /ˈhaɪdʒiːn 卫生/ obsessed than usual.

30
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:47,239
Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing.

31
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,864
Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture,

32
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:55,718
obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms.

33
00:01:55,718 --> 00:01:59,847
Obsessions can manifest /ˈmænɪˌfɛst 出现；显示 货单；旅客名单/
as fears of contamination /kənˌtæmɪˈneɪʃən 弄脏，污染；污染物/ and illness,

34
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:02,196
worries about harming others,

35
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:08,035
or preoccupations /prɪˌɒkjʊˈpeɪʃən 偏见，成见；专心；专心的事物  (尤指精神上)先入为主/ with numbers,
patterns, morality /moʊˈrælɪti 道德/, or sexual /ˈsɛkʃuəl/ identity.

36
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:11,623
And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking,

37
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,938
to the fastidious /fæˈstɪdɪəs 难取悦的，挑剔的，苛求的，有洁癖的/ arrangement of objects,

38
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:18,534
or walking in predetermined /ˌpriːdɪˈtɜːmɪn 预先决定做/ patterns.

39
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,856
Myth three:

40
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:24,857
individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally /ɪˈræʃənəlɪ 不合理地/.

41
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:28,712
Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship

42
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:32,729
between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well.

43
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,358
Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions

44
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:38,444
despite being aware of their irrationality /ɪˌræʃəˈnælɪtɪ 不合理/

45
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:42,040
is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,489
OCD sufferers report feeling crazy

47
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,465
for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts

48
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,836
and finding it difficult 
to control their responses.

49
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:53,371
So what exactly causes OCD?

50
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:56,328
The frustrating /frʌˈstreɪt 挫败/ answer 
is we don't really know.

51
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:58,765
However, we have some important clues.

52
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:02,236
OCD is considered 
a neurobiological /ˌnjʊərəʊˌbaɪəˈlɒdʒɪkəl 神经生物学的/ disorder.

53
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:06,466
In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains

54
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:10,228
are actually hardwired  /ˌhɑːdˈwaɪəd  硬连线/
to behave /bɪˈheɪv 行事；表现/ in a certain fashion.

55
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,701
Research has implicated /ˈɪmplɪˌkeɪt 表明…有牵连  暗指/
three regions of the brain

56
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,900
variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive /ˈkɒɡnɪtɪv 认识的/ planning,

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,575
voluntary /ˈvɒləntrɪ 即兴演奏；自愿者 自愿的/ movement,

58
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:22,261
and emotional and motivational responses.

59
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:24,089
The other piece of the puzzle

60
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:28,271
is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin /ˌsɛrəˈtəʊnɪn 血清素/,

61
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,023
a neurotransmitter /ˌnjʊərəʊtrænzˈmɪtə 神经传递介质/ 
that communicates between brain structures

62
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,594
and helps regulate vital /ˈvaɪtəl 必不可少的；生命的/ processes,

63
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,417
such as mood, aggression, impulse control,

64
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,205
sleep, appetite /ˈæpɪˌtaɪt 食欲/, 
body temperature and pain.

65
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:46,728
But are serotonin /ˌsɛrəˈtəʊnɪn 血清素/ and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD

66
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:51,227
or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder.

67
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,768
We probably won't know until

68
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:56,726
we have a much more intimate /ˈɪntɪmɪt 熟悉的；亲密的/ 
understanding of the brain.

69
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:00,254
The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD,

70
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:03,462
including medications, which increase
serotonin /ˌsɛrəˈtəʊnɪn 血清素/ in the brain

71
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:06,513
by limiting its reabsorption /ri:əbˈsɔ:pʃən 再吸收/
by brain cells,

72
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:11,517
behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes /ˌdiːˈsensɪˌtaɪz 减少感光性,使不敏感/ patients to their anxieties,

73
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,660
and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive /ilektrəukənˈvʌlsiv 电痉挛 / therapy,

74
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,188
or surgery /ˈsɜːdʒərɪ/, when OCD doesn't respond
to other forms of treatment.

75
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,762
Knowing that your own brain 
is lying to you

76
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,000
while not being able 
to resist its commands can be agonizing /ˈæɡəˌnaɪzɪŋ 极度痛苦/.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,105
But with knowledge and understanding
comes the power to seek help,

78
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,750
and future research into the brain

79
00:04:31,750 --> 00:00:00,000
may finally provide 
the answers we're looking for.
