1
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:10,516
What's your sign?

2
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:12,006
In Western astrology /əˈstrɒlədʒɪ 占星学/,

3
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:16,386
it's a constellation /ˌkɒnstɪˈleɪʃən 星座/ determined by
when your birthday falls in the calendar /ˈkælɪndə/.

4
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:19,897
But according to the Chinese zodiac /ˈzəʊdɪˌæk/,
or shēngxiào,

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:24,387
it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal
assigned to your birth year.

6
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:28,458
And of the many myths explaining /ɪkˈspleɪn/
these animal signs and their arrangement,

7
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,188
the most enduring /ɪnˈdjʊərɪŋ 忍耐 持久的/ one is 
that of the Great Race.

8
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:36,358
As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor,
Ruler of the Heavens,

9
00:00:36,358 --> 00:00:41,348
wanted to devise /dɪˈvaɪz 设计/ a way to measure time,
so he organized a race.

10
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,928
The first twelve animals to make it
across the river

11
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:48,028
would earn a spot on the zodiac /ˈzəʊdɪˌæk/ calendar
in the order they arrived.

12
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:50,679
The rat rose with the sun
to get an early start,

13
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,078
but on the way to the river,

14
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,989
he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox.

15
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,809
Because the rat was small
and couldn't swim very well,

16
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,168
he asked the bigger animals for help.

17
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,909
While the tiger and horse refused,

18
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,388
the kind-hearted ox agreed
to carry the rat across.

19
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:08,370
Yet, just as they were about
to reach the other side,

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,109
the rat jumped off the ox's head
and secured first place.

21
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,509
The ox came in second,

22
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,979
with the powerful tiger right behind him.

23
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,129
The rabbit, 
too small to battle the current,

24
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:22,541
nimbly /ˈnɪmblɪ 敏捷地/ hopped across stones and logs
to come in fourth.

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,619
Next came the dragon,
who could have flown /fləʊn fly/ directly across,

26
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,199
but stopped to help some creatures
she had encountered on the way.

27
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:32,609
After her came the horse,
galloping /ˈɡæləp 飞奔/ across the river.

28
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,100
But just as she got across,
the snake slithered /ˈslɪðə 蜿蜒滑动/ by.

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,480
The startled /ˈstɑːtəl 惊吓/ horse reared /rɪə 后面/ back,
letting the snake sneak /sniːk 偷偷地/ into sixth place.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,400
The Jade Emperor looked out at the river

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,420
and spotted /spotted 发现/ the sheep, the monkey,
and the rooster /ˈruːstə/ all atop /əˈtɒp 在顶上/ a raft /rɑːft 筏/,

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,060
working together to push it 
through the weeds /wiːd 野草/.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,391
When they made it across,

34
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,020
the trio /ˈtriːəʊ 三人组/ agreed to give eighth place
to the sheep,

35
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,660
who had been the most comforting /ˈkʌmfət/
and harmonious /hɑːˈməʊnɪəs 和睦的/ of them, 

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,330
followed by the monkey and the rooster.

37
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,391
Next came the dog, 
scrambling /ˈskræmbəl 爬/ onto the shore /ʃɔː 岸/.

38
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,510
He was a great swimmer,

39
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,180
but frolicked /ˈfrɒlɪk 嬉戏/ in the water for so long
that he only managed to come in eleventh.

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,381
The final spot was claimed by the pig,

41
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,750
who had gotten hungry and stopped
to eat and nap /næp 小睡/

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,881
before finally waddling /ˈwɒdəl 摇摇摆摆地走/
across the finish line.

43
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:19,561
And so, each year is associated with one
of the animals in this order,

44
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,645
with the cycle starting over
every 60 years.

45
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,461
Why 60 and not twelve?

46
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:29,371
Well, the traditional Chinese calendar
is made up of two overlapping /əuvə'læp 重叠 盖过/ systems.

47
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:32,281
The animals of the zodiac are associated
with what's called

48
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,891
the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī.

49
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:41,101
Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems /stɛm/,
or tiāngān,

50
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,562
is linked with the five classical elements

51
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,292
of metal, xīn,

52
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,864
wood, mù,

53
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,602
water, shuǐ,

54
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,212
fire, huǒ,

55
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,252
and earth, tǔ.

56
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:55,521
Each element is assigned yīn or yáng,

57
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:57,581
creating a ten-year cycle.

58
00:02:57,581 --> 00:02:59,853
When the twelve animals
of the Earthly Branches

59
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,032
are matched with the five elements

60
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,693
plus the yīn or the yáng
of the Heavenly Stems,

61
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,614
it creates 60 years 
of different combinations,

62
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:11,424
known as a sexagenary /seksə'dʒi:nəri 六十的/ cycle, or gānzhī.

63
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:16,390
So someone born in 1980 would have
the sign of yáng metal monkey,

64
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,903
while someone born in 2007 
would be yīn fire pig.

65
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:24,913
In fact, you can also have an inner animal
based on your birth month,

66
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,962
a true animal based on your birth date,

67
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:31,773
and a secret animal based on 
your birth hour.

68
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,196
It was the great race 
that supposedly determined

69
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:37,213
which animals were enshrined /ɪnˈʃraɪn 铭记/
in the Chinese zodiac,

70
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:39,094
but as the system spread through Asia,

71
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,463
other cultures made changes
to reflect /rɪˈflɛkt/ their communities.

72
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,803
So if you consult the Vietnamese /ˌviɛtnəˈmiz/ zodiac,

73
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,684
you may discover that you're a cat,
not a rabbit,

74
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,353
and if you're in Thailand /ˈtaɪlænd/,

75
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:53,284
a mythical /ˈmɪθɪkəl/ snake called a Naga /ˈnɑːɡə/
replaces the dragon.

76
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:55,844
So whether or not you place stock 
in what the zodiac says

77
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,744
about you as an individual,

78
00:03:57,744 --> 00:04:07,744
it certainly reveals much about
the culture it comes from.
