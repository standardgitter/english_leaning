1
00:00:06,824 --> 00:00:08,004
For millennia /mɪˈlenɪə mɪˈlenɪəm  千禧年；一千年/,

2
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:12,414
the people of Britain had been using 
bronze /brɒnz 青铜/ to make tools and jewelry /dʒu:əlri/,

3
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:15,060
and as a currency for trade.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,100
But around 800 BCE, that began to change:

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,120
the value of bronze /brɒnz 青铜/ declined, causing 
social upheaval /ʌpˈhiːvəl 突变，剧变；隆起/ and an economic crisis—

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,766
what we would call a recession /rɪˈsɛʃən/ today.

7
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,646
What causes recessions?

8
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:35,066
This question has long been the subject 
of heated /ˈhiːtɪd 热烈的/ debate /dɪˈbeɪt/ among economists,

9
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:36,546
and for good reason.

10
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,866
A recession can be a mild /maɪld 温和的/ decline in 
economic activity

11
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,596
in a single country that lasts months,

12
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:47,406
a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications /ˌræmɪfɪˈkeɪʃən 分枝，分叉；衍生物；后果/ that last years,

13
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,846
or anything in between.

14
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:51,376
Complicating matters further,

15
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:55,026
there are countless /ˈkaʊntlɪs 无数的/ variables /ˈværiəbəl 变量/ that 
contribute to an economy’s health,

16
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:59,026
making it difficult to pinpoint /ˈpɪnˌpɔɪnt 精确地找到/
specific causes.

17
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:01,666
So it helps to start with the big picture:

18
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,776
recessions occur when there is a negative /ˈnɛɡətɪv 拒绝 否定 负数/
disruption /dɪsˈrʌpʃən 中断 扰乱/

19
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:07,636
to the balance between supply and demand /dɪˈmɑːnd dɪˈmænd 美/.

20
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:11,116
There’s a mismatch between how many 
goods people want to buy,

21
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:14,256
how many products and services producers 
can offer,

22
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:19,966
and the price of the goods and services 
sold, which prompts /prɒmpt 提示/ an economic decline.

23
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:23,156
An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand

24
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:27,236
is reflected in its inflation /ɪnˈfleɪʃən/ rates 
and interest /ˈɪn.trɪst/ rates.

25
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:31,686
Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive.

26
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:35,080
Put another way, the value 
of money decreases.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,950
Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing.

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,570
In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity.

29
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,770
But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,520
can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession.

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,020
Interest rates, meanwhile,

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,390
reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,600
The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,720
that borrowers pay to their creditors /ˈkredɪtə 债权人，贷方/
until the loan is repaid.

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,790
Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money,

36
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,490
which they can use to invest 
in more projects.

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,290
High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers,

38
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,565
slowing economic activity.

39
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,555
Fluctuations /ˌflʌktjʊˈeɪʃən  波动，涨落，起伏/ in inflation and interest 
rates

40
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:25,385
can give us insight into the health 
of the economy,

41
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:29,385
but what causes these fluctuations /ˌflʌktjʊˈeɪʃən  波动，涨落，起伏/
in the first place?

42
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:33,605
The most obvious /ˈɒbvɪəs/ causes are shocks 
like natural disaster, war,

43
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,717
and geopolitical /ˌdʒiːəʊpəˈlɪtɪkəl 地缘政治学的/ factors.

44
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:37,237
An earthquake, for example,

45
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:42,247
can destroy the infrastructure needed to 
produce important commodities /kəˈmɒdɪtɪ 商品；日用品/ such as oil.

46
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:47,557
That forces the supply side of the economy
to charge more for products that use oil,

47
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:51,935
discouraging demand and potentially 
prompting a recession.

48
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:55,624
But some recessions occur in times of 
economic prosperity /prɒˈspɛrɪtɪ 兴旺，繁荣，昌盛/—

49
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:59,044
possibly even because 
of economic prosperity.

50
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:03,344
Some economists believe that business 
activity from a market’s expansion

51
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,608
can occasionally reach 
an unsustainable level.

52
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:10,548
For example, corporations and consumers 
may borrow more money

53
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:14,828
with the assumption that economic growth 
will help them handle the added burden /ˈbɜːdən 负担；责任/.

54
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,381
But if the economy doesn’t grow as 
quickly as expected,

55
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:21,341
they may end up with more debt 
than they can manage.

56
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,051
To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect 
funds from other activities,

57
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,471
reducing business activity.

58
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:30,391
Psychology can also contribute 
to a recession.

59
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:34,551
Fear of a recession can become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy /ˈprɒfɪsɪ  n. 预言，预言能力/

60
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:38,550
if it causes people to pull back investing
and spending.

61
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,850
In response, producers might 
cut operating costs

62
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,930
to help weather the expected 
decline in demand.

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,810
That can lead to a vicious /ˈvɪʃəs 恶意的；恶毒的；堕落的/ cycle as cost 
cuts eventually lower wages,

64
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,800
leading to even lower demand.

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,610
Even policy /ˈpɒləsi/ designed to help prevent 
recessions can contribute.

66
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,740
When times are tough, governments and 
central /ˈsɛntrəl/ banks may print money,

67
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,500
increase spending, and lower central bank
interest rates.

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,960
Smaller lenders can in turn lower their 
interest rates,

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,470
effectively making debt “cheaper” 
to boost spending.

70
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,620
But these policies are not sustainable 
and eventually need to be reversed

71
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,822
to prevent excessive /ɪkˈsɛsɪv adj. 过多的，过分的/ inflation.

72
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:23,272
That can cause a recession if people have 
become too reliant /rɪˈlaɪənt 依赖的/ on cheap debt

73
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:25,202
and government stimulus /ˈstɪmjʊləs 刺激/.

74
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:30,032
The Bronze recession in Britain eventually
ended when the adoption of iron

75
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:33,256
helped revolutionize farming 
and food production.

76
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,416
Modern markets are more complex,

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,166
making today’s recessions far 
more difficult to navigate /ˈnævɪˌɡeɪt/.

78
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:43,486
But each recession provides new data to 
help anticipate /预料/ and respond

79
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:46,504
to future recessions more effectively.
