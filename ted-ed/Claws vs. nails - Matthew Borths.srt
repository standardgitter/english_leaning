1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,756
Consider the claw /klɔː  爪；螯，钳/.

2
00:00:08,756 --> 00:00:12,486
Frequently found on four-limbed /lɪmd 有肢的；有翼的；有枝的/
animals around the world,

3
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:15,566
it’s one of nature’s most 
versatile /ˈvɜːsəˌtaɪl 多用途的/ tools.

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,888
Bears use claws for digging 
as well as defense.

5
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:23,648
An eagle’s needle-like talons /ˈtælən 爪/ can pierce /pɪəs  刺穿/
the skulls /skʌl头盖骨/ of their prey.

6
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,567
And lions can retract /rɪˈtrækt （使）缩回/ their massive claws 
for easy movement,

7
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:29,940
before flicking /flɪk 弹开/ them out to hunt.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,405
Even the ancestors /ˈænsɛstə 祖先/ of primates /ˈpraɪmeɪt 灵长类的动物/ used to 
wield /wiːld 使用；行使；对付/ these impressive appendages /əˈpɛndɪdʒ 附加物；附属器官/,

9
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:39,785
until their claws /klɔː/ evolved /ɪˈvɒlv/ into nails /neɪl 钉子，指甲/.

10
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:44,867
So what in our evolutionary past led to 
this manicured /ˈmænɪˌkjʊə 修指甲/ adaptation /ˌædəpˈteɪʃən/,

11
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:49,740
and what can nails do that their 
sharper cousins can’t?

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,570
When nails  first appeared in the fossil /ˈfɒsəl/
record around 55.8 million years ago,

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,349
claws had already been present for 
over 260 million years

14
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:03,548
in the ancestors /ˈænsɛstə 祖先/ of mammals /ˈmæməl 哺乳动物/ and reptiles /ˈrɛptaɪl 爬虫动物/.

15
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:06,540
But despite the gulf /ɡʌlf 海湾，深渊；隔阂，分歧/ of time between 
their emergence /ɪˈmɜːdʒəns 出现，兴起/,

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,991
these adaptations are both part of the 
same evolutionary story.

17
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:14,253
Both nails and claws are made of keratin /kerətin 角质/—

18
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:20,926
a tough, fibrous /ˈfaɪbrəs 纤维的/ protein also found in 
horns /hɔːn 角，触角/, scales /skeɪl 鳞/, hooves /huːf  蹄 / and hair.

19
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:25,956
This protein is produced by a wedge /wɛdʒ  楔形物 / of 
tissue called the keratin /kerətin 角质/ matrix.

20
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,275
Rich in blood vessels /ˈvɛsəl 血管/ and nutrients /ˈnjuːtrɪənt/,

21
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:32,665
this protein factory produces an 
endless stream of keratin,

22
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:36,711
which is tightly packed into cells 
called keratinocytes /kerətinəsait 角质化细胞/.

23
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:42,241
These high-density cells give nails and 
claws their trademark /ˈtreɪdˌmɑːk 商标；特征/ toughness /ˈtʌfnɪs 韧性，坚韧/.

24
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:44,627
Since nails evolved from claws,

25
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:48,588
both adaptations produce keratinocytes 
in the same way.

26
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:50,788
The cells grow out from the matrix,

27
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:56,297
emerging from the skin where they die 
and harden into a water-resistant /rɪˈzɪstənt 有抵抗力的/ sheath /ʃiːθ  （刀的）鞘  避孕套/.

28
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:59,637
The primary difference between the 
two keratin coverings

29
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,278
is really just their shape,

30
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:06,228
which depends on the shape of the bone 
at the end of the animal’s digits /ˈdɪdʒɪt 手指，足趾；数字/.

31
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:11,417
In claws, the bed of keratinocytes  /kerətinəsait 角质化细胞/
conforms /kənˈfɔːm 使顺从；适应环境；（使）遵守 / to a narrow finger bone,

32
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:15,193
wrapping /ræp 包裹/ around the end of the digit 
and radiating /放射； 辐射/ outwards

33
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:17,497
to form a cone/kəʊn 圆锥体/-shaped structure.

34
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:21,501
Animals with nails, on the other hand, 
have much broader digits,

35
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:26,811
and keratinocytes /kerətinəsait/ only cover the top 
surface of their wide bones.

36
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,149
It’s possible that nails have simply 
persisted /pəˈsɪst 坚持；固执/ as a side effect

37
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:33,886
of primates /ˈpraɪmeɪt 灵长类的动物/ evolving wider, 
more dexterous /ˈdɛkstrəs 灵巧的，敏捷的/ fingers.

38
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:37,733
But given what we know about the 
habitats /ˈhæbɪˌtæt 栖息地/ of our primate ancestors,

39
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:43,373
it’s more likely that nails came with 
their own powerful advantages.

40
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,503
High in the forest canopy /ˈkænəpɪ 天篷，华盖 苍穹；树荫/ where 
these primates lived,

41
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:50,607
wide finger bones and expansive 
finger pads /pæd 垫/ were ideal

42
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,744
for gripping /ɡrɪp 紧握/ narrow branches.

43
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:56,367
And nails improved that grip /ɡrɪp 紧握/ even further.

44
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:59,749
By providing a rigid /ˈrɪdʒɪd 僵硬的；坚硬的；严格的/ surface 
to press against,

45
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:05,361
primates could splay /spleɪ 斜面，斜角 splay out 张开/ out their pads to 
create even more contact /ˈkɒntækt/ with the trees.

46
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:09,126
Additionally, nails improved the 
sensitivity of their digits

47
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:14,226
by providing an extra surface to detect 
changes in pressure while climbing.

48
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,748
This combination of sensitivity 
and dexterity /dɛkˈstɛrɪtɪ 灵巧 敏捷 /

49
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:22,658
gave our ancestors the precise /prɪˈsaɪs/ motor /ˈməʊtə/
control needed to snatch /snætʃ 夺取 抓住/ up insects,

50
00:03:22,658 --> 00:03:27,827
pinch /pɪntʃ  捏，掐/ berries /ˈberɪ  浆果/ and seeds, and keep a 
firm grip /ɡrɪp 紧握/ on slim /slɪm 苗条的/ branches /brɑːntʃ - bræntʃ美/.

51
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:33,794
The evolution of nails and the evolution 
of opposable /əˈpəuzəbl 可对抗的,可对立的/ thumbs /θʌm 拇指/ and toes /təʊ 脚趾/

52
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:35,749
are closely linked.

53
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,602
And when our ancestors moved 
down from the trees,

54
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:44,580
this flexible grasp enabled them to create
and wield /wiːld 操作；使用/ complex tools.

55
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,138
Even if it was possible for wide 
fingers to sport claws,

56
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:50,830
their sharp points would’ve 
likely interfered /ˌɪntəˈfɪə 干涉/

57
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,369
with these primates’ regular tasks.

58
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,978
Claws are ideal for piercing /pɪəs  刺穿/, 
puncturing /ˈpʌŋktʃə 刺，戳/, and hooking,

59
00:03:56,978 --> 00:04:01,938
but their points make grabbing difficult, 
and potentially dangerous.

60
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:07,552
However, both claws and nails are 
used in some unexpected ways.

61
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,267
Manatees /ˌmænəˈtiː 海牛/ use nails to grasp /ɡrɑːsp/ their food,

62
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:14,212
and researchers think elephant toenails /ˈtəʊˌneɪl 脚趾甲/
may sense vibrations /vaɪˈbreɪʃən 振动；感触/

63
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,812
in the ground to help them hear.

64
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:20,678
Meanwhile, some primates, 
like the aye-ayes /aɪ/ of Madagascar /ˌmædəˈɡæskə 马达加斯加岛/,

65
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,694
have re-acquired claws.

66
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:27,029
They use these extra-long appendages /əˈpɛndɪdʒ 附属物/ 
to tap branches and trunks /trʌŋk 树干/,

67
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,355
while listening for hollow /ˈhɒləʊ 洞，窟窿/ sections 
with their bat-like ears.

68
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,050
When they hear an opening, 
they burrow /ˈbʌrəʊ  挖洞 / into the tree

69
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,830
and skewer /ˈskjʊə  刺穿；串住/ grubs /ɡrʌb 幼虫/ with their needle-like 
middle finger.

70
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,788
We’ve only scratched /skrætʃ 临时拼凑的  抓；挠 / the surface of all 
the incredible ways nails and claws

71
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,463
are used throughout the animal kingdom.

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,614
But as for which of these 
adaptations is better?

73
00:04:49,614 --> 00:04:52,584
That’s an answer we may never nail down.
