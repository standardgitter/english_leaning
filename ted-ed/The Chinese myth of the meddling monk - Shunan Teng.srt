1
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:10,144
Xu Xian had just received yet 
another invitation

2
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,704
to the opening ceremony of the new 
Jin Shan Temple.

3
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,594
His wife, Bai Su Zhen,

4
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:17,574
had warned him not to attend.

5
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:21,064
Since she was in fact a benevolent /bɪˈnevələnt  仁慈的/ white 
snake spirit in human form,

6
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:24,194
their marriage had already weathered /weðəd 风华/
attacks by meddling /ˈmedəl 管闲事/ monks.

7
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:26,004
But devout /dɪˈvaʊt 虔诚的/ Buddhist /ˈbʊdɪst/ that he was,

8
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,774
Xu Xian felt obligated /ˈɒblɪˌɡeɪt 有责任的/ to make 
an appearance.

9
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:29,914
What they didn’t know

10
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,694
was that these invitations had come 
from none other than Fa Hai–

11
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:37,024
the misguided /ˌmɪsˈɡaɪdɪd/ monk who had 
tried to separate the young lovers,

12
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,794
almost killing Xu Xian in the process.

13
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:41,584
The monk confronted Xu Xian,

14
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,114
telling him that because he consorted /ˈkɒnsɔːt （使）陪伴/ 
with a demon,

15
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:47,484
he must remain at the monastery /ˈmɒnəstərɪ 修道院/
and cleanse his soul.

16
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:48,774
Xu Xian protested,

17
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:51,464
but Fa Hai would not let him escape.

18
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:53,904
At home, Bai Su Zhen was uneasy.

19
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,894
Her husband had departed so quickly

20
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:59,264
that she hadn’t been able to tell him 
she was pregnant /ˈpreɡnənt/ with his child.

21
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:03,384
And now he had been gone so long 
she sensed /sensd/ something must be wrong.

22
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:04,864
She made her way to the temple,

23
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,244
and upon encountering Fa Hai 
the monk threw his prayer mat /mæt 席子/,

24
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:10,444
which erupted /ɪˈrʌpt 爆发/ into fire and smoke.

25
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:11,974
Weakened from her pregnancy /ˈpreɡnənsi/,

26
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:15,944
Bai Su Zhen desperately /ˈdespərətlɪ 绝拼命地/ summoned /ˈsʌmən 召唤/  a fleet
of shrimp soldiers and crab generals

27
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:19,504
to subdue /səbˈdjuː 压制/ the monk,
and waves to put out the blaze /bleɪz 烈火/.

28
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,974
But the water also flooded the 
surrounding area,

29
00:01:21,974 --> 00:01:24,614
drowning /draʊn 淹没/ many innocent villagers.

30
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,864
For the first time, Bai Su Zhen had 
harmed humans,

31
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:30,864
and she fell out of the gods’ favor.

32
00:01:30,864 --> 00:01:32,494
With their blessing /bles 祝福/ retracted /rɪˈtrækt 撤回/,

33
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:35,984
Fa Hai attempted to trap her 
in his magical alms /ɑːmz 救济金/ bowl.

34
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:38,094
But just when all hope seemed lost,

35
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,564
a bright glow /ɡləʊ 红光/ came from within her belly /ˈbeli 腹部/,

36
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:43,174
saving her from the mad monk’s magic.

37
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,364
The couple fled /flee 过去/ home,

38
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:47,104
grateful to the mysterious /mɪˈstɪərɪəs/ power 
that had saved them,

39
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:51,654
and soon after, Bai Su Zhen gave 
birth to their son, Xu Shi Lin.

40
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,504
Yet despite this joyous /ˈdʒɔɪəs 快乐的/occasion,

41
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:55,654
Xu Xian was uneasy.

42
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:58,754
He was shaken by his wife’s accidental 
act of destruction,

43
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:02,264
and he feared the misfortune /ˌmɪsˈfɔːtʃuːn 灾祸/
it might bring upon their home.

44
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:03,364
Not a month later,

45
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:05,504
Fa Hai appeared at their doorstep.

46
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:10,084
He offered Xu Xian an alms /ɑːmz 救济金/ bowl to 
ensure good fortune for his newborn son.

47
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:11,406
Still wary /ˈweərɪ 谨慎的/ of the monk,

48
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:14,606
but also remembering Bai Su Zhen’s 
destructive act,

49
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,686
Xu Xian accepted the gift.

50
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,756
But as soon as the bowl 
entered their home,

51
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:23,686
it flew to Bai Su Zhen’s head 
and trapped her inside.

52
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,284
Against the family’s wishes,

53
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:28,314
Fa Hai buried /ˈberi/ the bowl beneath 
the Lei Feng Pagoda /pəˈɡəʊdə 佛塔/.

54
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,694
And when Xu Xian begged him to 
release his wife,

55
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,314
the monk sternly /ˈstɜːnlɪ 严厉地/ replied:

56
00:02:32,314 --> 00:02:35,834
“She will be free when the
iron tree blooms.”

57
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,174
Overcome with guilt,

58
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,054
Xu Xian ran away to a monastery /ˈmɒnəstri 僧侣/,

59
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,084
leaving Shi Lin in the care of his aunt /ɑːnt 阿姨/.

60
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:44,054
But there was something neither 
of them knew.

61
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:47,054
The boy was the reincarnation /ˌriːɪnkɑːˈneɪʃən 转世/
of Wen Qu Xing,

62
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:48,214
the wisdom /ˈwɪzdəm 智慧/ god,

63
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:51,304
sent to the family to reward 
Xu Xian’s devotion /dɪˈvəʊʃn 献身/.

64
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:55,204
It was this power that had protected 
Bai Su Zhen at the temple,

65
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:57,474
and as he grew, so did his wisdom.

66
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:02,794
At age 19, Shi Lin went to the capital 
city to take the nation-wide imperial /ɪmˈpɪərɪəl 帝国的/ exam

67
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:07,905
and obtained the highest score 
in all the empire.

68
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:11,895
The Emperor himself bestowed /bɪˈstəʊ 授予/
Shi Lin’s prize:

69
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:16,285
an ornate /ɔːˈneɪt 装饰华丽的/ hat decorated with 
jewel-encrusted /ɪnˈkrʌstɪd 外壳的/ flowers.

70
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,284
But though he returned home in glory /ˈɡlɔːri 光荣/,

71
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:21,574
the fate /feɪt 命运/ of his parents still 
weighed heavy on his mind.

72
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,644
Coaxing /kəʊks 哄/ his father from exile /ˈɛɡzaɪl 流放/,

73
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:28,554
Shi Lin took him to visit the Lei Feng 
Pagoda /pəˈɡəʊdə 佛塔/ to pay respects to his mother.

74
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:29,715
Kneeling before it,

75
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:33,135
he placed his jeweled prize on the 
iron tree as an offering.

76
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:36,455
Suddenly, the ground opened and 
Bai Su Zhen stepped out.

77
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:38,975
With her sins /sɪn 犯罪/ absolved /əbˈzɒlv 免除/ by 
the tribute /ˈtrɪbjuːt 礼物/ of a god,

78
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:40,905
and a blossom /ˈblɒsəm 花/ on the iron tree,

79
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,355
Shi Lin had freed his mother,

80
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,038
and reunited his family–

81
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:49,038
both mortal and divine /dɪˈvaɪn 神圣的/.

82
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:55,038
i wish we could be trees deep in the mountains, touching, twining /twaɪn 缠绕/ limb around limb /lɪm 树枝/
