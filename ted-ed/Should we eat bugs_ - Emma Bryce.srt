1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,520
[Why don't we eat bugs?]

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,124
For centuries, people have consumed bugs,

3
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:13,473
everything from beetles /ˈbiːtəl 甲壳虫/

4
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:15,351
to caterpillars /ˈkætəˌpɪlə 毛虫 履带/, locusts /ˈləʊkəst 蝗虫；洋槐/,

5
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,304
grasshoppers /ˈɡrɑːsˌhɒpə 蚱蜢/, termites /ˈtɜːmaɪt 白蚁/, and dragonflies.

6
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:20,449
The practice even has a name:

7
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:21,488
entomophagy /ˌentəˈmɒfædʒɪ 食虫习惯/.

8
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:24,257
Early hunter-gatherers /ˈɡæðərə/
probably learned from animals

9
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:27,370
that foraged /ˈfɒrɪdʒ 饲料 觅食/ for protein/ˈprəʊtiːn/-rich insects /ˈɪnsɛkt/
and followed suit /suːt 相配/.

10
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:31,507
As we evolved /ɪˈvɒlv 进化/ and bugs
became part of our dietary /ˈdaɪətərɪ 饮食的/ tradition,

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,368
they fulfilled the role
of both staple /ˈsteɪpəl 主食/ food and delicacy /ˈdɛlɪkəsɪ 佳肴；珍馐/.

12
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:39,250
In ancient Greece, cicadas /sɪˈkɑːdə 蝉/
were considered luxury snacks.

13
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:43,016
And even the Romans found
beetle /ˈbiːtəl 甲壳虫 / larvae /ˈlɑːviː  larvaS/ to be scrumptious /ˈskrʌmpʃəs 非常美味的/.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,125
Why have we lost our taste for bugs?

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,971
The reason for our rejection
is historical,

16
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:49,541
and the story probably begins

17
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:52,773
around 10,000 BC in the Fertile /ˈfɜːtaɪl/ Crescent /ˈkrɛsənt 新月/,

18
00:00:52,797 --> 00:00:54,248
a place in the Middle East

19
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,757
that was a major birthplace
of agriculture.

20
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:01,333
Back then, our once-nomadic /nəʊˈmædɪk 游牧的/ ancestors /ˈænsɛstə/
began to settle in the Crescent.

21
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:04,646
And as they learned to farm crops /krɒp/
and domesticate /dəˈmestɪkeɪt 驯养/ animals there,

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,084
attitudes changed,

23
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,530
rippling /ˈrɪpəl  涟漪/ outwards towards Europe
and the rest of the Western world.

24
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:10,839
As farming took off,

25
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,940
people might have spurned /spɜːn 一脚踢开/
bugs as mere /mɪə 只不过的/ pests

26
00:01:13,964 --> 00:01:15,508
that destroyed their crops.

27
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:18,367
Populations grew,
and the West became urbanized /城市化的/,

28
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,168
weakening connections
with our foraging /ˈfɒrɪdʒ 饲料 觅食/ past.

29
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:23,627
People simply forgot
their bug-rich history.

30
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:26,663
Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy /ˌentəˈmɒfædʒɪ 食虫习惯/,

31
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,256
bugs are just an irritant /ˈɪrɪtənt 恼人的/.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,216
They sting /stɪŋ 毒刺/ and bite and infest /ɪnˈfest 侵扰；寄生于/ our food.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,692
We feel an "sick /恶心/ factor"
associated with them

34
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:37,118
and are disgusted /dɪsˈɡʌstɪd/
by the prospect /prɔspekt 期望/ of cooking insects.

35
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:40,441
Almost 2,000 insect species
are turned into food,

36
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,542
forming a big part of everyday diets

37
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:45,334
for two billion people around the world.

38
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:48,386
Countries in the tropics /ˈtrɒpɪks/
are the keenest /kiːn 热心的/ consumers,

39
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,387
because culturally, it's acceptable.

40
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,318
Species in those regions
are also large, diverse /daɪˈvɜ:s/,

41
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:55,904
and tend to congregate /ˈkɒŋɡrɪɡɪt （使）聚集/ in groups or swarms /swɔːm 一大群 成群地移动/

42
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,870
that make them easy to harvest.

43
00:01:58,124 --> 00:01:59,855
Take Cambodia /kæmˈbəʊdɪə/ in Southeast Asia

44
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,320
where huge tarantulas /təˈræntʃʊlə 狼蛛/ are gathered,

45
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:04,438
fried, and sold in the marketplace.

46
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,477
In southern Africa,

47
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,642
the juicy /ˈdʒuːsɪ 多汁的/ mopane /mɒˈpɑːnɪ/ worm is a dietary /ˈdaɪətərɪ 饮食的/ staple /ˈsteɪpəl 主食/,

48
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,056
simmered /ˈsɪmə 炖/ in a spicy /ˈspaɪsɪ/ sauce /sɔːs/

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,554
or eaten dried and salted.

50
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:17,229
And in Mexico/ˈmɛksɪˌkəʊ/, chopped jumiles
are toasted with garlic /ˈɡɑːlɪk 大蒜/, lemon /ˈlɛmən/, and salt.

51
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,630
Bugs can be eaten whole to make up a meal

52
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:23,288
or ground into flour /ˈflaʊə 面粉/, powder,
and paste /peɪst 面团/ to add to food.

53
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,153
But it's not all about taste.

54
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:26,419
They're also healthy.

55
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:30,657
In fact, scientists say entomophagy /ˌentəˈmɒfædʒɪ/
could be a cost-effective solution

56
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,503
for developing countries
that are food insecure.

57
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:36,466
Insects can contain up to 80% protein,

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,313
the body's vital /ˈvaɪtəl/ building blocks,

59
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,856
and are also high in energy-rich fat,

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,264
fiber /ˈfaɪbə/, and micronutrients /ˌmaɪkrəʊˈnjuːtrɪənt 微量营养素/
like vitamins and minerals /mineral/.

61
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:47,228
Did you know that most edible insects
contain the same amount

62
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:50,223
or even more mineral iron than beef,

63
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:54,670
making them a huge, untapped /ʌnˈtæpt 未利用的/ resource
when you consider that iron deficiency /dɪˈfɪʃənsɪ 缺乏/

64
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:58,398
is currently the most common
nutritional problem in the world?

65
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,555
The mealworm /ˈmiːlˌwɜːm 黄粉虫幼虫/
is another nutritious /njuːˈtrɪʃəs/ example.

66
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:05,390
The yellow beetle larvae are native
to America and easy to farm.

67
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:07,983
They have a high vitamin content /ˈkɒntɛnt/,

68
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:09,246
loads of healthy minerals /mineral/,

69
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,977
and can contain up to 50% protein,

70
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:15,230
almost as much as in an equivalent
amount of beef.

71
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:17,822
To cook, simply sauté /ˈsəʊteɪ 爆炒的/ in butter and salt

72
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:21,066
or roast and drizzle /ˈdrɪzəl 毛毛雨/ with chocolate
for a crunchy /ˈkrʌntʃɪ 脆的/ snack /snæk/.

73
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,090
What you have to overcome in "sick factor,"

74
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:25,485
you gain in nutrition and taste.

75
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,249
Indeed, bugs can be delicious.

76
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,276
Mealworms taste like roasted nuts.

77
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,195
Locusts are similar to shrimp.

78
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,864
Crickets /ˈkrɪkɪt 蟋蟀/, some people say,
have an aroma /əˈrəʊmə 芳香/ of popcorn.

79
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:38,587
Farming insects for food
also has less environmental impact

80
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,365
than livestock farms do

81
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,361
because insects emit /ɪˈmɪt 排出/
far less greenhouse gas

82
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:46,288
and use up less space, water, and food.

83
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:48,511
Socioeconomically, bug production

84
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,641
could uplift people
in developing countries

85
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,099
since insect farms can be small scale,

86
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:57,049
highly productive, and yet
relatively inexpensive to keep.

87
00:03:57,073 --> 00:04:00,529
Insects can also be turned
into more sustainable food for livestock /ˈlaɪvˌstɒk 家畜/

88
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,735
and can be reared /rɪə/ on organic waste,

89
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,108
like vegetable peelings /piːl 皮 剥；削/,

90
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,998
that might otherwise
just end up rotting /rɒt 腐烂/ in landfills /ˈlændˌfɪl 垃圾填埋场/.

91
00:04:07,022 --> 00:04:08,640
Feeling hungry yet?

92
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:12,777
Faced with a plate of fried crickets /ˈkrɪkɪt 蟋蟀 /,
most people today would still recoil /rɪˈkɔɪl 畏缩/,

93
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:16,774
imagining all those legs and feelers /ˈfiːlə 试探；触角/
getting stuck /stʌk 陷入/ between their teeth.

94
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,028
But think of a lobster.

95
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:22,383
It's pretty much just a giant insect
with legs and feelers /ˈfiːlə 试探；触角/ galore /ɡəˈlɔː 大量地 <非正式;褒> /

96
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:25,587
that was once regarded
as an inferior /ɪnˈfɪərɪə 低等的/, repulsive /rɪˈpʌlsɪv 令人厌恶的；排斥的/ food.

97
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:27,596
Now, lobster is a delicacy /ˈdɛlɪkəsɪ 佳肴；珍馐/.

98
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,392
Can the same paradigm /ˈpærəˌdaɪm 范例/ shift
happen for bugs?

99
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,631
So, give it a try!

100
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,526
Pop that insect into your mouth,

101
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,550
and savor /ˈseɪvə 品尝/ the crunch /krʌntʃ 嘎吱嘎吱地嚼/.
