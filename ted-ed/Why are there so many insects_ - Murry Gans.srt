1
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:10,159
If insects suddenly morphed /mɔːf 变种 变体/
into large beings,

2
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,449
and decided to wage /weɪdʒ 薪水 开展/ war on us,

3
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:15,731
there's no doubt /daʊt/ that humans
would lose.

4
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,625
We'd simply be crushed /krʌʃ 击垮 迷恋/
by their sheer /ʃɪə 绝对的 十足的/ numbers.

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:23,621
There are an estimated 10 quintillion /kwin'tiljən  10^18  10^20/
individual insects on Earth.

6
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,095
That's a one followed by 19 zeroes.

7
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:29,960
So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion,

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,204
these invertebrates /ɪnˈvɜːtɪbrɪt 无脊椎动物,无骨气的人/ outnumber /ˌaʊtˈnʌmbə  数目超过/
us by more than a billion to one.

9
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:39,646
Their astounding /əˈstaʊnd 使震惊/ numbers exist
at the species level, as well.

10
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,122
There are more than 60,000
vertebrate /ˈvɜːtɪˌbreɪt 脊椎动物/ species on the planet.

11
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:47,761
But the class of insects contains
a million known species,

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,458
and many others 
that haven't been classified.

13
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:58,445
In fact, these critters /ˈkrɪtə  生物；人；动物/ make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth.

14
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:01,095
So, what's their secret to success?

15
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,368
Insect abundance /əˈbʌndəns 大量/ comes down
to many things

16
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:08,293
that together make them some of the most
adaptable /əˈdæptəbəl 适应/ and resilient /rɪˈzɪlɪənt 有弹力的；恢复快的；适应力强的/ creatures,

17
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:11,346
beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed.

18
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:15,246
Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring /ˈɒfˌsprɪŋ 后代/ within their lifetimes.

19
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:16,859
Most offspring will die,

20
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,714
but more than enough will survive
into adulthood /ˈædʌltˌhʊd/ to reproduce.

21
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,457
Offspring also mature /məˈtjʊə 变成熟/ very rapidly,

22
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:26,704
so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly,

23
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:30,403
and can occur over and over again
in a short time.

24
00:01:30,403 --> 00:01:32,402
These numbers mean that as a class,

25
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:36,783
insects harbor /hɑ:bə 港湾 庇护，收养/ a tremendous /trɪˈmɛndəs 极大的，巨大的；极好的；极度的/ amount
of genetic /dʒɪˈnɛtɪk 基因的/ diversity.

26
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:39,995
The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data

27
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:43,533
that give them the necessary adaptations /ˌædəpˈteɪʃən/
they need to thrive /θraɪv 繁荣/

28
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,496
in a range of environments
across the planet.

29
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,779
Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds /baʊnd 范围/;

30
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:54,091
Flat bark beetles /ˈbiːtəl 甲壳虫/ can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit /ˈfærənˌhaɪt 华氏du/,

31
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,415
Sahara /səˈhɑːrə/ Desert /ˈdɛzət/ ants /ænt/ can venture /ˈvɛntʃə 冒险/ out

32
00:01:56,415 --> 00:02:00,431
when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees,

33
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:06,489
and some bumblebees /ˈbʌmbəlˌbiː 大黄蜂/ can survive
18,000 feet above sea level.

34
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:09,868
Insect exoskeletons /eksəu'skelitn 外骨骼/ also work
like body armor,

35
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,390
protecting insects against
the outside world

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,493
and helping them cope with habitats /ˈhæbɪˌtæt 栖息地/
that other creatures can't.

37
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:18,110
Even their small size,

38
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,455
which we might see as a disadvantage,

39
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,902
is something they use to their benefit.

40
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,877
Because most species are so tiny,

41
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:27,698
millions of insects can inhabit /ɪnˈhæbɪt 栖息/
a small space

42
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:31,559
and make use of all the available
resources within it.

43
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:36,350
This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches /niːʃ 小群体/ across ecosystems.

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,930
Some insects survive by eating the roots,

45
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,959
stems /stɛm 茎/,

46
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,769
leaves,

47
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,586
seeds,

48
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:42,315
pollen /ˈpɒlən 花粉/,

49
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,568
and nectar /ˈnɛktə 花蜜/ of specific plants.

50
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:46,082
Others, like wasps /wɒsp 胡蜂/,

51
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:50,063
make use of live insects 
by paralyzing /ˈpærəlaɪz 使瘫痪，使麻痹/ the victims

52
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:52,097
and laying their eggs inside

53
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:54,191
so that when the hatchlings emerge,

54
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:57,802
they can eat their way out
and get nourishment /ˈnʌrɪʃmənt 食物；营养（品）/.

55
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,595
Mosquitos /mɒˈskiːtəʊ  蚊子/ and biting flies feed on blood,

56
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:05,106
taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival.

57
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:08,867
And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche /nɪtʃ 凹陷/ around feces /ˈfiːsiːz 排泄物，渣滓/.

58
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,556
Flies lay their eggs there,

59
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,298
and some beetles /ˈbiːtəl/ even build
large balls out of animal dung /dʌŋ 粪便/,

60
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:18,268
which they eat and use as accommodation /əˌkɒməˈdeɪʃən 膳宿/
for their eggs.

61
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:21,972
And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis /ˌmɛtəˈmɔːfəsɪs 变态 【动物学】/.

62
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:24,611
This trait /treɪt 特征/ not only transforms insects,

63
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,725
but also helps them maximize /ˈmæksɪˌmaɪz/
the available resources in an ecosystem.

64
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,013
Take butterflies.

65
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,888
In their larval /ˈlɑːvəl 幼虫/ caterpillar /ˈkætəˌpɪlə 毛虫 履带/ form,

66
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:36,198
they chomp /tʃɒmp 用力咀嚼/ hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate

67
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,706
to help them grow and spin cocoons /kəˈku:n 茧/.

68
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:40,574
But when they emerge as butterflies,

69
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:43,337
these insects feed only on flower nectar /ˈnɛktə/.

70
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:47,210
Metamorphosis /ˌmɛtəˈmɔːfəsɪs 变态 【动物学】/ means the larvae /ˈlɑːviː 幼虫复数/
and adults of one species

71
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,068
will never compete /kəmˈpiːt 竞争/ for the same resource,

72
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:53,195
so they successfully share 
an ecological niche /niːʃ 小群体/

73
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:55,671
without limiting their own success.

74
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,373
This process is so efficient

75
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:03,687
that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis /ˌmɛtəˈmɔːfəsɪs 变态/.

76
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,232
We're big and they're small,

77
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:09,957
so it's easy to forget that these critters /ˈkrɪtə  生物；人；动物/
are moving in their millions

78
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:11,339
all around us,

79
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:12,953
all the time.

80
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,268
But examine almost any patch /pætʃ 小片 补丁/ of ground,

81
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:17,267
and you're sure to find them there.

82
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:20,877
Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched /无可比拟的/.

83
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,159
We may have to accept 
that it's insects,

84
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:24,641
not us,

85
00:04:24,641 --> 00:00:00,000
that are the true conquerors  /ˈkɒŋkərə 征服者/
of the planet.
